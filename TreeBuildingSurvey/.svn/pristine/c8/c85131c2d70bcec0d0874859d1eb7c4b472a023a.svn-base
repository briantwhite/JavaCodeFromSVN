to do list

1) use filename as student's name in welcome screen    							-DONE
	- filter to be sure it contains only alphanumeric & spaces					-DONE

2) hierarchy of error messages (only show first one at a time)					-DONE
	- included all
	- connected all
	- no cycles
	- score

3) could score by existing scores												-DONT BOTHER
	- maximize vert-invert diff, etc
	- minimize mam-mam diff, etc

4) if directory in command line, open in adminmode and open all .tree files
	- create scores.csv in that directory
		Name, error, comments

5) remove "you've received 15 points" if it's an application					-DONE
	in instructions.properties

6) robinson-foulds																-DONE
	break a link
	take organism 0
	mark all those that are connected to it
		if all in one group => a cycle (warn)
	all others aren't
	use large int for partition
		2^(creature index) = 1 if in a group
	see which of these are present/absent

7) Fix the null pointer issue on launch											-DONE

8) when loading multiple .tree files											- DONE
	if you hit an error (can't read it)
	then put the name of the file and "can't open" in the first score column

9) Why does DeguenonJosianeHomeworkB.tree get scored as having loops when it doesn't?
	it may be when they have unconnected branch nodes
	or terminal branch nodes
		(breaking the link to these still has all orgs connected so it looks like a loop)
	- probably detect these and warn before getting to loops etc
		(right after all orgs terminal)
	- her tree also has connectors going to empty space(?)
		need to warn about these
		
10) add to score report file
	unconnected branch nodes
	terminal branch nodes
