This is a folder of sample trees for unit testing

all used.tree - all dragged of home placement; no links
all connected.tree - all connected
correct.tree - correct tree used in making scoring
testtree.tree - a random tree

they score like this: 

Name,UsedAllOrgs,ConnectedAllOrgs,AllEndsOfBranches,NoLoops,Error
all connected,Y,Y,N,-,-
all used,Y,N,-,-,-
correct,Y,Y,Y,Y,0
tes,Y,N,-,-,-

added another
DeguenonJosianeHomeworkB.tree - scoring says it has loops
	it doesn't but it has a lot of unused nodes...

083EboigbeHarrisontreetreetree.tree
	this one uses NO organisms
		caused an error on "all connected"
		because vertices.size() = 0
		but it shouldn't get there - none of the orgs are used
		weird (update score [uses numUnusedOrgs != 0] gives "not all used" but
			scores.csv [uses numUnusedOrgs ? > 0] gives all orgs used...
