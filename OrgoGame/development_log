how to make it run
edit the source
build with the JWTK
run with the JWTK

AOK

to get from CVS
- check out as
- select C:/WTK25/apps
- it will expand into C:/WTK25/apps/OrgoGame

to include images, will need to make a jar
created classes/images
created build.xml
- just to make jar
 
not working - even though the .jad talks about OrgoGame.jar
it does not use that when running, it uses the classes in classes/
not the jar

punted

just get it running for now

put images in classes/images & see if it works

it does

to make pix:
- in mac, run chem draw
- copy
- new from clipboard in graphicconverter
- save to desktop
- drag to images folder in parallels

got it to load images into array
made first State: ReactantState

8/26/07
got model-view-controller to work with starting material and product states
model = ProblemSet
view = all the Displayables
controller = Controller

can toggle back & forth between starting mat & prod

8/27/07
working on getting problemSet accessor methods
and some UI stuff

8/28/07
got all major states going
need to make SelectReactionState work

8/29/07a
got SelectReactionState to work
add and delete work AOK
but need to get add in the middle of the list working
- need a flag to carry over?
- put in CVS

8/29/07b
got the add in middle thing to work
got it to check answer ok
to do
- get scoring to work
- if correct, automatically do new problem after the alert returns

8/30/07
the prev versions were for modp2.0 and cldc1.1
this is not standard on all phones
therefore, go to midp1.0 and cldc1.0
change in the Java WTK for CLCD 2.5
 - in settings, set API to TargetPlatform MIDP 1.0

- had to fix:
 - controller: replace with instanceof
 - problemSet: no nextInt(4) allowed - replace with code from book
 - list states don't have delete all - add to ListState
 	this was no good
 		-deleted from SelectReactionState (not needed)
 		- harder with EditAnswerState - size() doesn't seem to work
 			just make a new one each time
 - list doesn't have setSelectCommand - nuke
 
 works AOK (finally!)
 
 problem - if you have it do something right after the alert that says
 you got it right - it never shows the alert!
 
 9/1/07
 strange behavior - when you get it wrong after getting it right a few times (?)
 it freezes...
 put in lots of prints in ProblemSet.isCurrentListCorrect()
 but still unclear...
 
 9/4/07
 if you give an answer with the right number of steps but a wrong rxn
 then one with the wrong number of steps
 it goes into lala land 
 but ONLY IF THE DEBUG CODE IS MISSING
 if debug code present, it works AOK!!!
 (sometimes it goes to lala land with debug code missing...)
 
 test setup
 SM: amide
 P: alcohol
 wrong ans: OH-, reduction
 check answer & sometimes it goes to lala land when debug code absent
 it "never" seems to when the debug code is present...
 wtf?
