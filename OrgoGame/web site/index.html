<center><h3>Cell Phone Organic Chemistry Game</h3></center>
This game is designed to help you to practice learning synthetic reactions 
  in Organic Chemistry.<p>
It has been developed by <a href="../bw/">Brian White</a> at the University of
  Massachusetts, Boston.<p>
This game requires that your cell phone have Java capability. It has been found to work on 
  the following phones/providers:
<ul>
  <li>Nokia N95</li>
  <li>Sprint PCS</li>
</ul>

<b>How do I get the game on my cell phone?</b><p>
You either click on <a href="../wml/">this</a> link or enter this url into your cell phone's 
  web-browser:<br>
<code>http://intro.bio.umb.edu/wml/</code><p>
You then click to download the game.  This process differs on different phones.<p>

<b>How does it work?</b><p>
The game consists of one or more <i>Problem Sets</i>.  A problem set is a set of several
  related interconvertable molecules.  The game randomly chooses pairs of these molecules
  - a <i>starting material</i> and a <i>product</i> - 
  and your task is to determine the reaction or reactions required to turn the starting material
  into the product.  When you think you have the correct set of reactions, you can ask
  the program to tell you if you've got it right.  Once you have successfully solved
  all the possible conversions, you are done.  The program keeps track of how long
  it took you to complete the problem set so that you can practice for better and
  better times to prepare you for timed exams.<p>

Since this game runs entirely on your cell phone, you do not need cell phone service to run it
  once you have downloaded it.<p>

<b>How do I use it?</b><p>
First, find the game file on your cell phone and run it. This process differs on different phones.<br>

<b>Are there more problem sets available?</b><p>
Right now, there is only one problem set. I am looking for collaborators to develop more.  
You do not need to know Java to develop problem sets; only organic chemistry.<p>
