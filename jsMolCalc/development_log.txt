need to fix - when you draw an illegal molecule, it gets marked as "correct"
	- need to fix that illegal molecule can't be correct
	- need two methods that are accessible from the page:
		public String isValid() - returns "true" or "false" if molecule is OK or not
		public String getError() - returns "" or the error string (if not valid)
