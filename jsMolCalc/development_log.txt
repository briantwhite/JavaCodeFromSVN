started off
following tutorial from http://www.vogella.com/articles/GWT/article.html
- did not use GoogleAppEngine

put jme.jar in war/ directory to try to build it into page

working

pasted in code for calculations from MolCalc 3.0
put all in jsMolCalc.java
	make Atom and AtomSpec classes inside jsMolCalc

11/25/12

works when compiled and posted to web

12/3/12

12/5/12
added ability to import and export molfiles

need to fix - when you draw an illegal molecule, it gets marked as "correct"
	- need to fix that illegal molecule can't be correct
	- need two methods that are accessible from the page:
		public String isValid() - returns "true" or "false" if molecule is OK or not
		public String getError() - returns "" or the error string (if not valid)

reconstructed (had been lost in migration to git)

started new Google/Web Application Project

restored from time machine backup from March 2013
dragged folders into git directory

error - couldn't find /Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsMolCalc/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml
just stole one from jsVGL
ditto for /Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsMolCalc/war/WEB-INF/logging.properties

missing other crap
copy in all from default version to war/WEB-INF/lib

seems to work but java plugin is ng on apple!

try with jsme from http://peter-ertl.com/jsme/
version 2013-05-30
put in the /jsme into war/

got error
Unable to find 'jsme.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source?
maybe it's trying to build jsme?
weird - you don't get the error until you try to connect (it seems to build fine)

have to compile and then run from browser (not chrome - it won't run unless on a server)
firefox is best
needed to change native methods to use $doc.JME not $doc.getElementById('JME')
works!

working on version for web
	nix the load and save molfile parts - have them only work if non-null
	change html to be more friendly
