started up
got jdom.jar from http://www.jdom.org/dist/binary/ 
version 1.1.1
- got .tar.zg
- unzipped
- in jdom/build, there's jdom.jar
- put it in lib/ in the project workspace
- tar -xvf jdom.jar
- delete all files not in org/
- build path - add class folder lib/

cleaned up stuff
- moved all needed VGLII stuff into VGLII package
- stripped VGL and VGLII main classes down to essential methods
	removed GUI stuff

to make it work with VGLII need to make converters to change a VGLII Cage to a VGL cage
(and, of course, the organisms inside it)
got it going.

worked on getting it to notice conspicuous crosses
working on tallying the results to find out when they have all the info they need
need to implement the getRequiredResultSet method for each genetic model in VGL and VGLII

7/14/10
got tallying of required info working
need to check one problem of each type
(and get it going for VGLII)

problem:
in hierarc/circ dom if you get R X B -> R + G (eg 111 F07 gbr180.wrk cage 5)
	you get a LINKED result
		it tells you, for sure that R > B
		but G is recessive to EITHER R or B but not both
			once you find one, you get the other
therefore, need to deal with this linkage
	but it's different than in inc dom - in that case, it does not give linked info
		with inc dom A X B -> C gives all the info you need
	so, the RequiredResultSet will deal with DominanceResults with three phenos
		differently depending on the model involved
or, better, make a distinction between A X B -> only C and A X B -> C + (A or B)
	A X B -> only C (inc dom) fires 3 results
			Dominance(A B), Dominance(B C), & Dominance(A C)
	A X B -> C + others fires LinkedResult
also, need to process a cage as a unit, not by phenotype
	that is, collect the phenos you've found and process that into the GeneticResult

problem with HashMaps not finding elements
- can find them if iterate thru KeySet and look for equals() on keys
- but not using the regular contains() and get() methods
- did not implement hashCode()
try this.
works!!!

now, need to add sex-linkage twist - for autosomal, need to show that it is autosomal

7/26/10
got it working!
now conspicuous results are coded like this:
- BLACK = shows sex linkage
- WHITE = shows dominance
- GRAY = shows both
** but beware: partial no sex-linked results (like 1/2 of a reciprocal cross) count as showing sex-linkage

NOW - need to get it running with VGLII.

7/28/10
added debug option to turn on/off printing of diagnostic stuff
compile-time option in the VGLLogAnalyzer

getting a 
     [java] Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
     [java] 	at java.util.HashMap$HashIterator.nextEntry(HashMap.java:793)
     [java] 	at java.util.HashMap$KeyIterator.next(HashMap.java:828)
     [java] 	at LogAnalyzer.RequiredResultSet.processResult(RequiredResultSet.java:145)
 looking on the web:
 "Note that this exception does not always indicate that an object has been concurrently 
 modified by a different thread. If a single thread issues a sequence of method invocations 
 that violates the contract of an object, the object may throw this exception. For example, 
 if a thread modifies a collection directly while it is iterating over the collection with 
 a fail-fast iterator, the iterator will throw this exception."
 
 this method modifies the collection linkedResults while iterating over it.
 need to fix
 fixed it
 
 also, for logging purposes, have it output the filenames of each deleted table row

need to check files with models not yet tested:
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10

8/2/10
a criss-cross result (male A X female B -> male B + female A)
	gives a LINKED result (had had it as pure dominance result)
		if you know mode of sex-linkage, you know dominance & vice-versa
need to make linked results with sex-linkage

8/4/10
but there's another result that can come with sex-linked hierarchical models:
	A X B -> A (both) + male B + male C
	you should get 2 linked results:
		linked (sex-linked, dom(A,B))
		linked (dom(A,C), dom(B,C))

11/22/10
some tuning on the "shows sex linkage" and "shows dominance"
make sure they are checked off whenever needed
and tallied for display and export
all set
