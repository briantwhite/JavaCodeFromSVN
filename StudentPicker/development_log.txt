set up
needs files:

1) in iClickerLogs (SessionFiles) 
	scores.txt
		"Name" \t 0
	- will be updated as each score added

2) in sp files
	"do not call.txt"
		name (no quotes) (one per line)
	
	"students.txt"
		"name" \t iClickerID (leading #, leading 0's removed)

made sure resetting the settings clears out all the data
version 1.1

7/11/11
moving to pc
issues:
- what about the line terminator char
if you use od -tc on mac files, it's \n; on pc it's \r\n
according to javadoc BufferedReader.readline()
	Read a line of text. A line is considered to be terminate
	by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), 
	or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.
- so it should be OK


need to revise some of the files
there'll be a Bio111/Roster.txt file I had to make for the registration
it's in format: <lastname>,<firstname and initial>,<id#>
like:
	Abelard,Christina A,1024868
	Abreu,Maranjellie,1049407
	Accilien,Cassandre,1114705


and there's going to be Bio111/SessionData/RemoteID.csv
in the format: #<iclicker#>,"<id #>"
like:
	#18C0D50D,"1049407"
	
use these instead of students.txt

so, put everything in the Bio111 dir
only one point required: "Directory where this course's files are stored"
get Roster.txt from there
get do not call.txt from there
	use names formatted from scores.txt
get SessionData/RemoteID.csv from there
get/put scores.txt there

set up some test files with windows line breaks

now working

9/7/11
revised to use an Integer for the student ID 
so it no longer worries about leading zeroes
version 2.1

9/9/11
revised ScoreSacver so, if the class list grows in scores.txt
(if students add class)
it will create an entry before updating
version 2.2

found the preferences on windows xp (may not have been being deleted right)
start menu -> Regedit
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\Student\Picker

11/11/11
need to prevent double-dipping (once you've got credit, you can't be called again)
in two places:
- on startup, remove those who have scores > 0
- on giving points, remove name
version 2.3

1/11/12
modified:
- no points for pass
- 2 points for answer
- added new button "No reply" -1 point

something isn't right with making scores.txt
some names in class list aren't in the scores.txt

1/13/12
fixed score saver so scores.txtis made right
tested
version 2.4
version 2.4

1/25/12
fixed bug on startup and made it so it really updates the prefs
(it didn't save it in the past!)
version 2.5

1/26/12
fixed "do not call.txt" bug (White,Brian T not White, Brian T - no extra space after the comma)
version 2.6
