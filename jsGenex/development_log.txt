new -> Google -> Web Application Project
nuke server stuff
moving code from Jean-Michel Claus' gwt-ification of Genex
got it from https://github.com/MITx/Blades/tree/master/genex
only have src/
	drag in files to client/
	also put content of Genex.gwt.xml into JsGenex.gwt.xml
	content of public/genex.css to war/JsGenex.css
	put images/ in war/
had to fix package
nuked DocumentRenderer

coundn't find server class
edited web.xml to remove that reference

can get it to build but it makes war/genex folder
	not war/jsgenex folder
	why?
	- line in JsGenex.gwt.xml: <module rename-to
	
how to run it?
look in mitx_all/mitx/common/static/js/capa
	find some stuff on genex
	especially edit-a-gene.js
		put it in war
		add reference to JsGenex.html
		
it couldn't find "$wnd"
need to add jquery
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
to JsGenex.html

now visible
but can't respond to key strokes

test posting - again

maybe key stroke thing is because we didn't register the callbacks

trying on home mac, but now it can't find
Unable to find 'edu/umb/bio/genex/JsGenex.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source?
this is because it's edu/umb/bio/jsGenex/JsGenex.gwt.xml
where is the reference?
in Run As -> Run Configurations -> arguments 
	program arguments contained edu.bio.umb.genex.JsGenex in addition to the correct one edu.umb.bio.jsGenex.JsGenex
	deleted wrong one and it seems to work
	
weird errors with jQuery stuff
added jquery-1.10.1.min.js to war/
edited JsGenex.html to use this one
didn't help
error is in GenexGWT.java notifyHostpage()
	expects int, gets undefined
	probably because the reference to $wnd is no good
