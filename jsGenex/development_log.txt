new -> Google -> Web Application Project
nuke server stuff
moving code from Jean-Michel Claus' gwt-ification of Genex
got it from https://github.com/MITx/Blades/tree/master/genex
only have src/
	drag in files to client/
	also put content of Genex.gwt.xml into JsGenex.gwt.xml
	content of public/genex.css to war/JsGenex.css
	put images/ in war/
had to fix package
nuked DocumentRenderer

coundn't find server class
edited web.xml to remove that reference

can get it to build but it makes war/genex folder
	not war/jsgenex folder
	why?
	- line in JsGenex.gwt.xml: <module rename-to
	
how to run it?
look in mitx_all/mitx/common/static/js/capa
	find some stuff on genex
	especially edit-a-gene.js
		put it in war
		add reference to JsGenex.html
		
it couldn't find "$wnd"
need to add jquery
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
to JsGenex.html

now visible
but can't respond to key strokes

6/10/13
test posting - again

maybe key stroke thing is because we didn't register the callbacks

trying on home mac, but now it can't find
Unable to find 'edu/umb/bio/genex/JsGenex.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source?
this is because it's edu/umb/bio/jsGenex/JsGenex.gwt.xml
where is the reference?
in Run As -> Run Configurations -> arguments 
	program arguments contained edu.bio.umb.genex.JsGenex in addition to the correct one edu.umb.bio.jsGenex.JsGenex
	deleted wrong one and it seems to work
	
weird errors with jQuery stuff
added jquery-1.10.1.min.js to war/
edited JsGenex.html to use this one
didn't help
error is in GenexGWT.java notifyHostpage()
	expects int, gets undefined
	probably because the reference to $wnd is no good

maybe not - you need to have fields with genex_dna_sequence and genex_problem_number
found them in mitx/common/lib/capa/capa/templates/editageneinput.html

still seeing the JS type errors in notifyHostpage();
	getting string when expecting int
also: notifyHostpage(){[]} JSON.parse: unexpected character
	perhaps they're related
probably a problem in edit-a-gene.js
	it's looking for a missing field - maybe ingenexGetInputField - looking for .problem

can run it in chrome if you start chrome with open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security

6/11/13
using chrome and the edx site and the js console
did window.genexGetInputField() and it gave back:
[
<input type=​"hidden" name=​"input_i4x-MITx-7_00x-problem-PSet4_graded_P4_Q5a_2_2_1" id=​"input_i4x-MITx-7_00x-problem-PSet4_graded_P4_Q5a_2_2_1" value=​"{"genex_dna_sequence":​"AGCCT","genex_answer":​"INCORRECT"}​">​,
<input type=​"hidden" name=​"problem_id" value=​"{"genex_dna_sequence":​"AGCCT","genex_answer":​"INCORRECT"}​">​
]
try putting these in JsGenex.html

same errors and window.genexGetInputField() gives []
what is ".parent"?
go into edx page and look for window.$('#genex_container').parents('.problem')
	and it finds a <section class="problem>
					</section>
			wrapping the genex prob
	try adding that.
	NG
but - the quotes are somehow messed up - if you do window.genexGetInputField()
	there are weird extra blue quotes...
there are characters <U+200B> - "zero width space"
see them in TextWrngler by view -> text display -> show invisibles
removed them
	still NG
had to make internal quotes be single quotes
	at least now, the color coding of the result of window.genexGetInputField() in chrome
		matches the 7.00x mooc version
	but still has errors
	
also - can't click on bases until you've entered a new DNA sequence...

e-mailed JMC and he said
	genexGetInputField is the one causing the problem. It looks for that hidden 
	field whose value is the saved state that can be graded by the Python backend.

	So, just add third hidden input field and give it a name. Then do not use 
	genexGetInputField that looks for the <input type="hidden" name="input_${id}" 
	id="input_${id}" value="${value|h}"/> in the template.

if you delete the $wnd.genexIsReady(); from GenexGWT.notifyHostpage() you don't get that error
so it's in the genexIsReady()
no errors if you comment out the whole genexIsReady() function (but no genex shows up either)

break it down:

if only comment out:
        if (genex_saved_state === '') {
            //Load DNA sequence from xml file 
            genex_dna_sequence = genex_default_dna_sequence;
        }
        else {
            //Load DNA sequence from saved value
            genex_saved_state = JSON.parse(genex_saved_state);
            genex_dna_sequence = genex_saved_state.genex_dna_sequence;
        }
still get errors

comment all but last part below         //Now load mouse and keyboard handlers
	different errors
	
found 2 problems
	- the string found when expecting int comes from 
		var genex_problem_number = $('#genex_problem_number').val();
		- try fixing by taking quote out of JsGenex.html value="1"
			NG, try parseInt()
			OK!
			
	- the unexpected ' token is from
		    genex_saved_state = JSON.parse(genex_saved_state);
            genex_dna_sequence = genex_saved_state.genex_dna_sequence;
 		- try switching quotes to value='{"genexblabla":"fred"}'
 
 NOW FULLY AOK!

working on "evaluate answer" dialog
got it to show

<sigh> when you GWT compile, it nukes the .css file in war/jsgenex
	need to protect it somehow
		can't move it out - it's in the equivalent of the war/ folder on the edX site
same with jsgenex/images
	ditto
	
keep them out of war/jsgenex
then copy them in after compiling <sigh>

Tried to integrate into edx - put in mitx_all/mitx/common/static/js/capa/genex
	NG - it looks for something called genex not jsgenex
	made changes in JsGenex.gwt.xml
		- <module rename-to='genex'>
		-   <stylesheet src='genex.css' />
		
	better - no error but no genex window (only the buttons)
	why? what's looking for what?
- but it may be broken other ways 
	when I restore the .../capa/genex directory to yesterday's version - it doesn't even show the buttons in genex
	but it works fine if you open JsGenex.html in a browser
- will need to talk to edX

working on button keyboard (for iPad and also other key click issues with some computers)
weird thing - whenever you get a dialog, the selected base is no-longer selected
	but all other highlighting stays...
		why?
found the problem - in GenexGWT's 	public static native void setClickEvent(GenexGWT gn)
	if the click wasn't on the DNA, it clears the selection (right after gn.@edu.umb.bio.jsGenex.client.gx.GenexGWT::dnaStrandWasClicked = false;)
					//Refresh the display to erase the blue selection
					gn.@edu.umb.bio.jsGenex.client.gx.GenexGWT::eraseBlueSelection()();
		- I don't think this is necessary
			nuke it out

7/2/13
added level 0 problem - make a gene that makes a protein of 5 aas (no intron needed)

also, had trouble with standard page loading long default DNA
because of parameter
	<input type="hidden" name="input_i4x-MITx-7_00x-problem-PSet4_graded_P4_Q5a_2_2_1" id="input_i4x-MITx-7_00x-problem-PSet4_graded_P4_Q5a_2_2_1" value='{"genex_dna_sequence":"TAAGGCTATAACCGAGATTGATGCCTTGTGCGATAAGGTGTGTCCCCCCCGAAAGTGTCGGATGTCGAGTGCGCGTGCAAAAAAAAACAAAGGCGAGGACCTTAAGAAGGTGTGAGGGGGCGCTCGAT","genex_answer":"CORRECT"}'>
but if you leave it out, you get an error
that's because bad coding in edit-a-gene.js
	line 52 tests if genex_saved_stats is undefined 
		initially it was genex_saved_state === ''
		this is WRONG - must be typeof(genex_saved_state) == 'undefined'
		see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3390396/how-to-check-for-undefined-in-javascript
		
added textbox with state info for grading
	optional - if left out, you don't get an error
	otherwise, on "evaluate answer" it puts the GenexState.toString() in that box for grading

need to build nicely for edX
- add xsiframe tag to JsGenex.gwt.xml (to deal with SOP)

it was badly kludged up to make a custom problem type in edX
may be able to save it using semi-kludged parts in JsGenex.html

when compiled with xsiframe, now the buttons are there but the main genex window is blank - not even a border
it claims to be looking for genex/genex.css
	but why? - there's genex.css in the same folder as JsGenex.html - the file that asks for it.
	tried moving genex.css to genex/genex.css - lose error but still NG
it's also failing in edit-a-gene.js's waitForGenex() method
	genex doesn't have an onInjectionDone() method - why?
	GenexGWT.java does have onInjectionDone()  but you can't see it from javacript
weird - on pedex page, it looks for pedex.onInjectionDone() and start-pedigrees.js runs AOK but
	from web page, pedex is undefined
	but genex IS defined - could that be the problem?

8/20/14
one thing at a time: the "can't find genex/genex.css"
	unlike other .gwt.xml's genex.gwt.xml has a reference to the stylesheet as genex.css
		try deleting that line in .gwt.xml
code was:
	  <!-- Specify the application specific style sheet.              -->
	  <stylesheet src='genex.css' />
now that it's gone, there's no "can't find css error"

but still "undefined is not a function" error

try making a simpler wait for genex js file - based on start-pedigrees.js
	call it start-pedex.js
	use that in JsGenex.html instead of edit-a-gene.js
still NG
where does the object genex come from? where is it declared?
genex exists as an object in the page
genex() generates a new genex page

if you take out the reference to start-genex.js, the error goes away but still nothing in window
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="start-genex.js"></script>

there are important things called in edit-a-gene.js
	genexIsReady() is called when ready and it loads stuff
	try putting these into start-genex.js with dummy values
	
works - IF you take out the wait for genex code
   waitForGenex();

    function waitForGenex() {
        if (typeof(genex) !== "undefined" && genex) {
            genex.onInjectionDone("genex");
        }
        else {
            setTimeout(function() { waitForGenex(); }, timeout);
        }
    }

but this code works FINE in other jsWhatever's
weird - in pedex, in JsPedigrees.gwt.xml , module rename-to="jspedigrees"
	but in the waitForPedex, they use pedex (so where's it defined???)
	- in genex, in JsGenex.gwt.xml, module rename-to="genex"
		maybe a namespace thing?
	- try in JsGenex.get.xml rename-to="jsgenex"
get this error:
	Unable to find 'genex.gwt.xml' on your classpath...

if you put
    console.log(typeof(genex));
into start-genex.js; you get
	function

if you do the same to start-pedex.js (before waitForPedex();)
	you get
		undefined
		(that's why it waits)

so its a name thing.
but there's nothing called pedex in the pedex page

try "jsgenex" in the wait code
WORKS - that's weird: it seems like you can call it ANYTHING!
now go back and fix edit-a-gene.js to work OK and then use that one (for backward compatibility)
	may have to add methods to getGrade, etc - FAILS
	PUNT on that one

make completely new
first, fix some bugs:
1) when protein is 1aa long, the underline is never cut off and spills over the page.

8/21/14
fixed (1)
but if stop codon split by intron - underlining is all messed up

have to do some refactoring
- nuke out BWBuffer - no need for B&W text on web page
	therefore, nuke HTMLContainer
- underline base-by-base <u>A</u> etc
FINALLY FIXED
