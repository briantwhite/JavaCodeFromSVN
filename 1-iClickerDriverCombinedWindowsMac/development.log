downloaded project from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/da527fp2ue4gpaz/AAC4MFLjrA61YCLSG-6HTwaaa?dl=0
put in eclipse (it has the .project etc files in it)
•	Downloaded zip to desktop (it comes down as 1-iClickerDriverCombinedWindowsMac/)
•	In eclipse, Import -> General -> existing projects into workspace
o	Check the box “Copy projects into workspace” - IMPORTANT
•	Seemed to work

Add to git
•	Right-click the project -> Team-> Add to index
•	Commit
•	Push to upstream
•	Check on github.com – all there!

Now, need to build it.
the driver file I use in the clicker app is iClickerDriverWindowsMac.jar
	download it's lib/iClickerDriverWindowsMac.jar and use cmp to this project's lib/iClickerDriverWindowsMac.jar
		they're the same
	but how do you make the jar?
what's in it?
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
iClickerDriver/TimeProcess.class
iClickerDriver/DriverType.class
iClickerDriver/IClickerDriverNew.class
iClickerDriver/ParseInstructionNew.class
iClickerDriver/StringProcess.class
iClickerDriver/ParseInstruction.class
iClickerDriver/ButtonEnum.class
iClickerDriver/BuildInstructionsOld.class
iClickerDriver/BuildInstructions.class
iClickerDriver/Vote.class
iClickerDriver/IClickerDriver.class
iClickerDriver/IClickerDriverOld.class
iClickerDriver/FrequencyEnum.class
iClickerDriver/TimeEnum.class
iClickerDriver/ParseInstructionOld.class
iClickerDriver/BuildInstructionsNew.class

it's all that's in bin/iClickerDriver
so, should be able to set up project in eclipse with a build.xml that builds this jar.
