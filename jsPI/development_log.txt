nuke server stuff
moving code from Jean-Michel Claus' gwt-ification of protex
got it from https://github.com/MITx/Blades/tree/master/protex
only have src/
	drag in files to client/
	also put content of Genex.gwt.xml into JsGenex.gwt.xml
	content of public/genex.css to war/JsGenex.css
	put images/ in war/
avoided package issues by just copying in src folder contents

fixed errors
- nuke ProteinImageSet - since no history list
- nuke SingleLetterCodeDocument - not used (JMC must've did the editing differently)
- nuke TargetShape - not used 
- in protex.client.java.awt.Graphics
	need to take out lots of @override lines (why are they there?)
- protex.client.java.awt.geom.Path2D.java needs Curve
	got from web the sun.awt.geom.Curve.java code
		dragged into protex.client.java.awt.geom

need to set up JsPI.html

went to mitx_all/mitx/common/static/js/capa
	got design-protein-2d.js
	put in war/
	put in reference in JsPI.html

added jquery also to JsPI.html

try to run
get error Failed startup of context com.google.appengine.tools.development.DevAppEngineWebAppContext
in WEB-INF/web.xml
	nuked servlet lines
no more error

now, need to get it to display in page
getting errors in graphics classes like
	floatToIntBits is undefined for type FLoat
	doubleToLongBits is undefined for type Double
these are hash code methods for implementing comparable
it looks like GWT version 2.5.0 has code for this
	but I'm running 2.4.0
		see in Project->Properties->Java Build Path
tried updating eclipse - NG

went to https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/versions
	got http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/files/gwt-2.5.1.zip
	install in /Applications/eclipse/plugins/com.google.gwt.eclipse.sdkbundle..

test commit from home
	did (all in eclipse)
		git hard reset
		git pull
		import from git 
			local
				just jsPI
	seemed to work

need input params
looked in mitx_all/mitx/common/lib/capa/capa/templates/designprotein2dinput.html
    <input type="hidden" name="target_shape" id="target_shape" value ="${target_shape}"></input>
    <input type="hidden" name="input_${id}" id="input_${id}" value="${value|h}"/>
get real PI page in edx and search in text for these strings to get values

got it to display, but still some errors on folding
