moving code from Jean-Michel Claus' gwt-ification of protex
got it from https://github.com/MITx/Blades/tree/master/protex
only have src/
	drag in files to client/
	also put content of Genex.gwt.xml into JsGenex.gwt.xml
	content of public/genex.css to war/JsGenex.css
	put images/ in war/
avoided package issues by just copying in src folder contents
