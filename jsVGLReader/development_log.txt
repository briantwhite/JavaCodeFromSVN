Set up project to build a java application reader for jsVGL files so TAs can
	- see what the right answer is so they can give hints
	- see if the students got it right

for the jsvglReader
	- set it up to look in a directory of .jsvgl files
	- show real and student model also graded or not
	- steal a lot of code from VGLII.Grader.Grader - maybe just start by copying all that out
		can delete WorkFileLoader
		no need for matching code or CageScorer (since already in the jsVGL).
		try to reduce the amount of VGL Genetic Model code
		
will need a password in case it falls into the wrong hands
