Set up project to build a java application reader for jsVGL files so TAs can
	- see what the right answer is so they can give hints
	- see if the students got it right

for the jsvglReader
	- set it up to look in a directory of .jsvgl files
	- show real and student model also graded or not
	- steal a lot of code from VGLII.Grader.Grader - maybe just start by copying all that out
		can delete WorkFileLoader
		no need for matching code or CageScorer (since already in the jsVGL).
		try to reduce the amount of VGL Genetic Model code
		
will need a password in case it falls into the wrong hands

working on it

need to read json
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-can-we-read-a-json-file-in-java
got json-simple-1.1.1.jar from http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple111jar.htm
put in jsVGLReader/ folder
added as external jar in project properties

used this site to make the json easier to read https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print

starting to get it to read and interpret the json in the .jsvgl files (in method jsVGLReader.getModelsFromFile())

rather than reconstructing the correct answer and student answer from the jsVGL data, save them as html in the .jsvgl file
	maybe use light encryption for the correct answer.
need to edit jsVGL.

got jsVGL to export the html for student and correct answers - that should make it easier.

need json-simple from https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads

got it to compile but, although you can see the file .jsvgl in the directory, it does not appear on screen?
	it is being added to the list but the display is not updating!

maybe it's a thread thing. Don't build the UI until you've selected the files?
that's a little tricky since you need (I think) to have a little UI up before you can open the file chooser.

probably the best way is to steal code from VGLII and make a thread so the GUI updates.

got it to work without encryption

need to:
- test with several files - OK!
- put back encryption and test
	first, need to get it to read the file to a string and parse it unencrypted - OK
	working with encryption!
	
all set!
