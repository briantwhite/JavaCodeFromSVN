edited to gwt-ify
error
classnotfoundexception GreetingServiceImpl - don't want server
needed to edit war/WEB-INF/web.xml to remove all server crap

almost working - need to get location of click on the canvas properly
	once I added header stuff, it was off...

clicking wasn't working to get popup
revised to use single click

made it a little faster (maybe)
by going to arrays of Strings in possibleGenotypes

problem (always there but not noticed)
when one grandparent must be carrier but don't know which, it should reduce to:
	Aa A_ and A_ Aa
in this case:
raw sets are:
Autosomal Recessive
	Possible; geno sets are:
		1:A A 2:A a 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A A 2:A a 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 
		1:A A 2:A a 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A A 2:A a 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A A 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A A 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A A 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A A 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A a 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A a 3:A A 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A a 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A A 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A a 3:A a 4:A a 5:A a 6:A a 7:a a 

consolidates to:
Autosomal Recessive
	Possible; geno sets are:
		1:A _ 2:A a 3:A _ 4:A a 5:A a 6:A _ 7:a a 
		1:A a 2:A A 3:A _ 4:A a 5:A a 6:A _ 7:a a 

note that, in the second set, the 2: is AA not A_

this is because there are 12 in the raw set not 16
so, once you consolidate 2 x 4 you can't do the last set of 4
hmmm...

the easiest solution is to never report AA becuase you can never be sure it's not Aa
so convert all AA's to A_'s as last step

- moved sanity checks from PedigreeSolver to Pelican
- in consolidate - once numDiffs > 1 punt (you don't need to know how many if it's 2 or more)

working on state and grading for edX integration
build the getGrade exported functions into jsPedigrees.java 
	use JsVGL.java as model
got it to export and import xml state and grade
grade looks like this
<Grade>
    <Counts>
        <M>1</M>
        <F>3</F>
        <aM>0</aM>
        <aF>1</aF>
    </Counts>
    <Analysis>
        <AR>Y</AR>
        <AD>N</AD>
        <SR>N</SR>
        <SD>N</SD>
    </Analysis>
</Grade>

aM = affected males
gwt compiled

8/19/14
move all exported methods to one place - Pelican
gwt compiiled with xsiframe flag in jsPedigrees.gwt.xml
fixed arrangement of html page

weird error - if you access jsPedigrees from http://intro.bio.umb.edu/MOOC/jsPedigrees/JsPedigrees.html
the edit menus appear way up on the page - not right above the person like they're supposed to
this happens on chrome
it doesn't happen as much on the SPOC but it sometimes happens
if you run it from chrome from the file in git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsPedigrees/war/JsPedigrees.html it is OK.
maybe need to look into stuff.
first need to get it running - installed the GWt stuff a la http://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html
then in project settings => GWT => general settings - enable GWT
can't get it to malfunction...

there's some stuff here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9907108/change-gwt-submenu-popup-location
	in Pelican.java, every time you make a MenuBar, add this code (except for Edit menu)
		personMenu.addStyleName("dropDownMenuStyle");
	in JsPedigrees.css, add this:
		.dropDownMenuStyle {
		position: Absolute;
		right: 0px;
		}
experiment with parameters.
this seems to be the best
.dropDownMenuStyle {
	position: Relative;
}

uploaded and replaced - seems OK
in omega's website/MOOC/jsPedigrees

still not right - sometimes doesn't work = no response to click
added print to console code
	public static native void console(String text)
	/*-{
	    console.log(text);
	}-*/;

found some of the problem
	screen[x][y] is a map of the screen from 0,0 to PEDIGREE_SIZE ,PEDIGREE_SIZE (600,600)
		if = 0, nothing there; otherwise, the id of the person there
		when pedigree drawn, this is filled in
	the click handler uses the event x,y to map into screen(x,y)
		BUT on chrome, the x,y's are
			0,123		600, 122
			
			0,1236		600, 1200 (and you get an error here probably because of index out of range)
	
	WTF - not only is y offset by ~120, the y scale seems to be wrong too...
Pelican extends AbsolutePanel
	try FocusPanel - ng: breaks all the widget stuff

several different getX and getY methods
	result depends on the event's source
try
		console("getY=" + event.getY() + " getScreenY=" + event.getScreenX() + " getClientY=" + event.getClientY() + " getRelativeY=" + event.getRelativeY(event.getRelativeElement()));

upper left corner:
	getY=0 getScreenY=70 getClientY=442 getRelativeY=0
but if I scroll, the upper left corner is:
	getY=436 getScreenY=71 getClientY=8 getRelativeY=436

so getY = getRelativeY (for the event's target) - and these depend on where the y scrolling is 
	- that explains the intermittency!
but none of them are all that good.
try event.getRelativeY(this.getElement())); (this = pelican)
	no help
need it relative to the drawing canvas - whatever that is.
	try rootPanel - still NG
nothing seems to be constant when scrolled!

try finding something you can subtract to get constant values..
		console("EVENT: getY=" + event.getY() + " getScreenY=" + event.getScreenY() + " getClientY=" + event.getClientY() + " getRelativeY=" + event.getRelativeY(this.getElement()));
		console("THIS: getAbsTop=" + this.getElement().getAbsoluteTop() + " getScrollTop=" + this.getElement().getScrollTop() + " getOfsetTop=" + this.getElement().getOffsetTop());

EVENT: getY=364 getScreenY=214 getClientY=82 getRelativeY=364
THIS: getAbsTop=80 getScrollTop=0 getOfsetTop=442
scroll
EVENT: getY=3 getScreenY=577 getClientY=445 getRelativeY=3
THIS: getAbsTop=442 getScrollTop=0 getOfsetTop=442

absTop is the only one that changes with scrolling
	try screenY - absTop
		first = 134
		second = 135
	could be OK!

Pelican line 1162
	public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
		int x = event.getScreenX() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteLeft();
		int y = event.getScreenY() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteTop();
		console("EVENT: x=" + x + " y=" + y + " contents=" + screen[x][y]);
		if (screen[x][y] != 0) {
			currentPerson = getPersonById(screen[x][y]);
			popup.showRelativeTo(currentPerson);
			popup.show();
		} else {
			popup.hide();
		}

	}

upper left is now a constant 58,132 or so
maybe that's the button size??
maybe use the bottom right and subtract the screen size
		int x = event.getScreenX() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteRight() + PEDIGREE_SIZE;
		int y = event.getScreenY() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteBottom() + PEDIGREE_SIZE;
no effect; get same values for upper left corner but it is "scroll-proof"

actually, clientY is probably better
		int x = event.getClientX() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteLeft();
		int y = event.getClientY() - this.getElement().getAbsoluteTop();
seems fixed
try again
it is fixed!
	the first time you click on person 1, it puts the menus in a weird place but after that, it's OK
	don't worry about that
