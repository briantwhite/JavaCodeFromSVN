can connect to jsresponse like jsVGL
from Julian Arni
I tried doing jsGenex, and the only issue I came across was the issue we also had with jsVGL - cross-domain stuff, 
which it seems compiling with certain options fixed. So if you know how to recompile it that way, and have some place 
to host it (your website?) just having <jsinput html=<your host>>, and then specifying the grading and saving functions, 
should do it.

idea for consilidating from Liam Revell

"average" the data
	for each column, count the number of times each genotype appears
		probably will only be
			all dd, all Dd => report dd or Dd as appropriate
			50/50 Dd/DD => report D_
only problem:
	what if conditionals (eg parents of carrier: if one is DD, the other must be Dd)
	may be ok to just report at D_
	
to do it right:
average all genos
any that aren't 0 or 1 are ambiguous
for each ambiguity
	for each possibility
		fix that possible genotype for that person
			average the remaining columns for that set 
				(eg, what's the average for the others if grandpa is DD?)

any time you find a non 50/50 split in the average, you have to report a new genotype set

strictly speaking, you need to recursively do this on all ambiguitites
	in case there are more sophisticated dependencies

to do this, you need a good data structure that allows row and column sorting & searching & sub-setting
core is routine that gives average of a submitted array with or without a set genotype
