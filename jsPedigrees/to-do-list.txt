* need to check that pedigree doesn't have bad parents before solving
	use checkIntegrity()

* to tell where clicked
	make 600x 600 int array - see if new fills with 0's (it does)
		as you place persons, fill coords with id#
	only popup if in right place
	know current person this way
	
* add loading callback like edx uses to get the new pedigree automatically
