* change the "person" menu to a little image

* include sanity checks from pedigree solver in Pelican (move them up)

* credit the pelican guy on the page

* right-click (hold touch) doesn't work on ipad - you get the regular context menu
maybe use smartgwt

*performance tuning
2) add things to the DOM like the 3rd tip at http://blog.cruxframework.org/2010/10/performance-tuning-on-gwt-applications.html
3) in pedigree solver, use regular arrays not collections and/or write it in javascript
	http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsJSNI.html
4) in consolidate - once numDiffs > 1 punt (you don't need to know how many if it's 2 or more)
5) in solver - getPossibleGenotypes makes new vectors each time! make a 3-d string array indexed by model #
