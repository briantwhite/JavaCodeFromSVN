* change the "person" menu to a little image

* include sanity checks from pedigree solver in Pelican (move them up)

* credit the pelican guy on the page

* right-click (hold touch) doesn't work on ipad - you get the regular context menu
maybe use smartgwt

*performance tuning
1) in drawing pedigree - make an array of all the PelicanPeople at the top and use it over an over
	(not keep doing .getWidgetCount())
2) add things to the DOM like the 3rd tip at http://blog.cruxframework.org/2010/10/performance-tuning-on-gwt-applications.html
3) in pedigree solver, use regular arrays not collections and/or write it in javascript
