can connect to jsresponse like jsVGL
from Julian Arni
I tried doing jsGenex, and the only issue I came across was the issue we also had with jsVGL - cross-domain stuff, 
which it seems compiling with certain options fixed. So if you know how to recompile it that way, and have some place 
to host it (your website?) just having <jsinput html=<your host>>, and then specifying the grading and saving functions, 
should do it.
