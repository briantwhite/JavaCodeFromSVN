0	THE REASON THAT I CHOSE THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY FOR THE CAUSE IS DUE TO ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN IF ONLY ONE STUDY WAS GIVEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION IF ANOTHER STUDY WAS ADDED TO THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN THE ANSWER MAY BECOME EVEN MORE REFINED I CHOSE MY ANSWER THROUGH A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION WHEN I LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF THE INFORMATION FROM EACH STUDY I CONCLUDED DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM STUDY ONE I WASNT COMPLETELY CLEAR ON WHAT THE ANSWER SHOULD BE FROM STUDY TWO I WAS LEANING MORE TOWARDS BACTERIA AND AFTER THREE IT SEEMED CLEAR THAT IT HAS MUCH MORE TO DO WITH THE DIET THAN ANY GENETIC REASON BUT COULD STILL POSSIBLY BE BACTERIA I WOULD DO MORE RESEARCH ON BACTERIA AS A CAUSE	11	BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN TO THIS WORLD WE LIVE IN WE INTERACT WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND BY INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE A DISEASE WITH MIGHT HAVE IT TOO	12	I THINK IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHICH ONE IS THE MOST LIKELY ONE BECAUSE I THINK THAT SOMEBODY WHO INHERITS THE DISEASE FROM BACTERIUM VIRUS DO NOT NEED TO HAVE DIETARY DEFICIENCY VICE VERSA THUS IS NOT EASY TO SAY WHICH ONE IS THE MOST LIKELY ONE	13	NONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE EXACT ENOUGH TO NARROW IT DOWN THEY ALL SEEM PLAUSIBLE TO ME BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO DECIDE WHICH ONES ARE MORE LIKELY	14	IN MY OPINION THE DISEASE IS PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON VIA A GERM VIRUS OR BACTERIUM AND IS THEREFORE CONTAGIOUS THROUGH BLOOD WASTE CONTACT COUGH SNEEZE CONTAMINATED FOOD ETC BECAUSE AS I SEE MOST OF DISEASES AFFECTED FROM PERSON TO PERSON ALSO I COULD FOUND OUT SOME INFORMATION FROM THE SURVEY THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE GOT AFFECTER BY THESE REASONS WHICH IS THE ANSWER FOR NUMBER FOUR QUESTION IN ADDITION AIDS IS ONE EXAMPLE THAT HAS CONNECTION WITH THIS ANSWER BECAUSE YOU CAN AFFECT THE DISEASE BY BLOOD OR CONTACT	15	BASED ON THE EXPERIMENT AND RESEARCH MOST OF THOSE CASES HAVE THE DISEASES BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINATED OF WATER BLOOD OR EVEN CONTACT WHO HAVE SICK SUCH AS HAND SHAKE SNEEZING OR WHO WORKED IN THE SOCIAL WORKER EAT SICK ANIMAL UNCOOKED MEAT ENVIRONMENT WASTE UNSAFE SEX	16	BECAUSE PATIENTS WERE ISOLATED AND GIVEN DIET DEFICIENT MEALS AND THEY WERE ISOLATED FROM OTHERS RULING OUT VIRUS OR BACTERIA CAUSES GENETICS WAS NOT OBSERVED	17	BACTERIUM VIRUS ARE MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE THE DISEASE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GENETIC MATERIAL ENTERS INTO HOST CELLS AND THOSE GENETIC MATERIAL USE HOST CELLS TO MULTIPLY AND WHEN THEY COME OUT OF HOST CELLS THE CELLS BURST AND CAUSE THE DISEASE SYMPTOMS	18	MOST LIKELY DISEASE CAUSE OF THE GENETIC BECAUSE IT WAS COMES ON YOUR GENE WITH PARENTS THE BACTERIA OR VIRUS CAUSE THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY MEDICINE TO CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT AND TO CHANGE IN FOOD BUT WE CANT CHANGE THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF A PERSON ITS COMES ON GENERATION ITS ONE GENERATION TO NEXT GENERATION THROUGH GENES SO GENETICS IS CAUSE MORE LIKELY THAN OTHERS	19	WE NEED TO THINK MORE ABOUT OUR DIARY HYGIENE WASHES HANDS PROPERLY COOK THE FOOD WELL AND OTHER STAFF THAT RELATE WITH THE HYGIENE	110	THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE IS BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE THE ALL THE DISEASE IS PASS FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER THROUGH GERMS AND IT IS CONTAGIOUS IT COULD BE ALSO BE GENETIC DISEASE WHICH IS PASS FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION	111	BACTERIUM VIRUS IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE THREE BECAUSE OTHER THAN ABOUT BACTERIA THERE IS NO REASONABLE STUDY	112	I THINK THAT DISEASE X MAY BE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DIET REQUIREMENTS TAKEN BY PEOPLE AS IF PEOPLE DONT TAKE THE NECESSARY DIET THAT IS REQUIRED AND THAT CANNOT BE MADE BY OUR BODY WOULD RESULT IN NON FUNCTIONING OF THE ENZYMES WHICH ARE PROTEINS THAT RESULT IN DISEASES I FEEL THAT THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO THE DISEASE CAUSED CALLED PKU EVEN THOUGH IF THERE IS A GENETIC DISEASE THAT IS RECESSIVE IT CAN AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL IF HE DOESNT TAKE PROPER DIET REQUIRED BY THE PERCENT DAILY VALUES	113	BECAUSE BASED ON ALL OF THE STUDIES IMMUNITY SEEMS TO BE A BIG FACTOR IN WHETHER THE SUBJECTS GET DISEASE X OR NOT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE MAY BE AIDED BY CLOSE CONTACT AND SPREADING OF THE BACTERIA BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT THE ONLY PATIENTS SUBJECT TO THE DISEASE IS DUE TO LOW IMMUNITY TO THE BACTERIA VIRUS BECAUSE THERE IS A DEFICIENCY IN THEIR DIET	114	THE DISEASE X WHICH IN THE FIRST DOCTORS EXPERIMENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DEFICIENCY BUT PURE BACTERIA INFECTION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER FROM THE ANALYSIS WE CAN SEE THAT MAJORITY WHO STAY CLOSE BY WERE INFECTED ON THE OTHER HAND THE SECOND AND THIRD DOCTORS MIX NUTRITION AND BACTERIA IN THE EXPERIMENT AND THE OUTCOME OF THE SECOND DOCTOR PRETTY SIMPLE BECAUSE THE FIFTH CHICKEN THAT WAS SICK HAD SOME LOW IMMUNITY OR SOMETHING BECAUSE SHE FELT SICK ALONE BUT STILL THE BACTERIA FACTOR CAUSED THE DISEASE	215	YES DISEASE IS CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN ONES DIET BECAUSE IN SURVEY 3 THERE ARE 20 MEN THEY ATE RICH DIET AND LIVED IN DIRTY HOUSES THEY DONT HAVE DISEASE BUT IN THE SAME SURVEY THERE ARE LIKE 11 MEN THEY LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE BUT THEY ATE POOR DIET SO THEY HAVE DISEASE LIKE IN POOR DIET THEY CANT FOUND VITAMIN A B C D IT HELPS HUMAN BEING TO BE HEALTHY LIKE IN GREEN FOOD THERE ARE LOTS OF VITAMIN IF SOMEBODY THEY DONT EAT GREEN THING AND FRUITS THEIR EYE CAN BE WEAK SO I CAN SAY THAT DISEASE IS CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN ONES DIET	216	I CHOSE THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY FROM THE START AFTER READING ABOUT THE CHICKEN WHO AFTER BEING FED THE POOR DIET DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THEN AS THE STUDY WENT ON TO SHOW HOW AFTER BEING PLACED IN A DARK ROOM AND THE POOR DIET WAS STOPPED THE CHICKENS SYMPTOMS IMPROVED IF THIS HAD BEEN A GENETIC DISEASE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CURED SIMPLY BY DIET	217	I THINK IT IS VIRUS OR BACTERIUM AND IS THEREFORE CONTAGIOUS FROM PERSON TO PERSON AT ANY REACTION BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X LIVED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND NOT NECESSARILY RELATIVES OR LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE BUT CLOSE BY AND SO IF THEY SOME HOW SEE EACH OTHER OR MEET THEY ARE GETTING THE VIRUS OR GIVING TO ONE ANOTHER I DONT THINK IT IS FROM WHAT ATE OR GENETIC AT ALL I BELIEVE THIS IS A VIRUS THAT IS SPREAD AROUND THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIVE CLOSE BY IF IT WAS FROM WHAT THEY ATE I THINK MORE PEOPLE IN THE AREA OR STATE WOULD BE ILL BECAUSE IF NOT 80 OF THE PEOPLE WITH IN THE USA 50 OF US EAT SIMILAR FOOD I WOULD PROBABLY SAY GENETIC TO IF ONLY THE PEOPLE WITH HEREDITY WERE SICK BUT THAT WASNT THE CASE SO I DEFINITELY THINK IT IS A VIRUS THAT IS CONTAGIOUS	218	I BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE X IS RELATED TO THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FED WITH POOR DIET WERE FOUND TO BE DISEASED EVEN THOUGH ONLY 6 OF THE MALES OUT OF 11 WERE DISEASED IT STILL INDICATES THAT THE DIET HAS A VERY IMPORTANT IMPACT IN THE DISEASE	219	I FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS VIRAL LITTLE INFORMATION WAS GIVEN THAT WOULD SUGGEST OTHERWISE THE DOCTOR IN THE FIRST STUDY MADE IT SOUND AS IF IT WERE VIRAL THE ONLY INFORMATION GIVEN WERE REGARDING NEIGHBORS AND PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE WHICH MADE ME BELIEVE THAT IT WAS VIRAL I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD TO BE ON THE SAME DIET I ALSO KNEW THAT IT COULDNT BE GENETIC BECAUSE THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD COULD NOT BE RELATED IN THE SECOND STUDY I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DIET BUT STILL WAS NOT SURE THE DOCTOR USED THE EXAMPLES OF CORNMEAL THAT HE HAD GIVEN THE CHICKENS BUT HE HAD MIXED IN SAMPLES OF THE BACTERIA THAT HE HAD GOTTEN FROM THE PATIENTS SO I GUESS IT COULDNT HAVE BEEN THE DIET THE DIET WAS CONTAMINATED BUT IT COULD STILL HAVE BEEN THE DIET THE PATIENTS WITH DISEASE X COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE DISEASE FROM SOMETHING THAT THEY ATE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WAS SOLD IN THE LOCAL MARKET FRUIT OR VEGGIES OR MAYBE EVEN CONTAMINATED MEAT SO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR DIET I GUESS I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT WHY WOULD YOU TEST THE CHICKENS WITH CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL WOULDNT THE CHICKENS BECOME CONTAMINATED IF THEY ATE THE CORNMEAL YET NOT ALL WERE SICK IN STUDY THREE I THOUGHT IT WAS A POOR DIET THE ELEVEN WHO WERE GIVEN A POOR DIET BECAME ILL WHILE THOSE WHO ATE A GOOD DIET HAD NOT GOTTEN SICK I WOULD SAY THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THE ELEVEN WHO GOT SICK LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE AND HAD NO CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHILE THE TWENTY WHO WERE HEALTHY LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE AND HAD CONTACT WITH PEOPLE IT COULDNT HAVE BEEN THE WATER BECAUSE THEY BOTH RECEIVED THEIR WATER FROM THE SAME LOCATION IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY ATE I FEEL THAT THE DISEASE IS LINKED TO THEIR DIET	220	THE 2ND DOCTORS STUDY IS NOT CONCLUSIVE ENOUGH FOR ME TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INFECTED CHICKENS DISEASE HAS ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE DISEASE BECAUSE EACH OF THE 9 BACTERIA SAMPLES WERE PUT INTO 9 DIFFERENT BOTTLES WHICH I THINK COULD MEAN THAT IN EACH OF THE BOTTLES IS THE SAME CONTENT IF ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT THE SYMPTOMS IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY THREE OPTIONS THE THIRD DOCTORS STUDY IS NOT CONCLUSIVE BETWEEN WHETHER THE CAUSE COULD BE A CONTAGIOUS OR A DIETARY RELATED DISEASE I THINK ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY BOTH OPTIONS ARE POSSIBLE THIS STUDY DOESNT TEST AT ALL FOR THE GENETIC RELATED OPTION THEREFORE IM ONLY GOING TO CONSIDER DOCTOR 1S STUDY IN THIS CASE 80 OF THE CASES HAD SOMEONE WITH THE DISEASE CLOSE OR IN THE SAME HOUSE WHEREAS ONLY APPROX 5 6 HAD SUPPOSEDLY NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER WITH THE DISEASE CARRYING PEOPLE THIS SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOWEVER IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND BETTER IF THE DISEASE COULD BE GENETIC THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT WHO IS RELATED TO WHOM AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO WAY TO DERIVE ANYTHING ABOUT THE OPTION OF A GENETIC DISEASE	221	I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY MY REASON FOR BELIEVING THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE DOCTORS STUDIES 1 3 THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY THEIR POOR DIETS	222	FOR DOCTORS ONE AND TWO DISEASE I WOULD PROBABLY SAY THAT IT IS A BACTERIUM VIRUS THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR ARE HIGHER THEREFORE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS DISEASE IS PASSED THROUGH GERMS PEOPLE COUGHING AN NOT COVERING THEIR MOUTHS AND IF THEY DO COVER THEIR MOUTH THEY END UP NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS PEOPLE EATING FROM THE SAME SILVERWARE WITHOUT WASHING IT AFTER THE OTHER PERSON IS DONE SO AS YOU ALL CAN SEE IT IS A BACTERIUM DISEASE BUT AS FAR AS DOCTOR THREE GOES I THINK THESE GUYS GOT SICK FROM NOT EATING THE PROPER MEAL I GUESS THE WAY THEY WERE EATING JUST WASNT RIGHT AND ALSO BECAUSE THE DIET THAT THEY WERE HAVING HAD MORE CARBOHYDRATES AND MUCH LESS PROTEIN THAN AVERAGE DIET YOUR DIET HAS A LOT TO DO WITH YOUR HEALTH EVERYONE KNOWS IF YOU DONT EAT RIGHT THAN OF COURSE YOU WILL END UP BEING SICK THATS JUST A FACT	223	I BELIEVE THE DISEASE X IS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN THE THREE CASES EXAMINED BY DOCTORS IT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE AT FIRST THAT THE DISEASE IS BACTERIUM VIRUS THIS IS BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS THE CONTACT AND CLOSE LIVING QUARTERS OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HOWEVER AS DISPLAYED IN CASE THREE THE DOCTOR CLEARLY SHOWS YOU THAT IT IS LACK OF DIET NOT ENVIRONMENT OR CONTACT IN CASE ONE ALL THE PEOPLE WERE IN CONTACT AND IT COULD BE SPREAD THROUGH GERMS BUT AFTER READING THE OTHER CASES YOU ARE LED TO BELIEVE THEY WERE PROBABLY EATING THE SAME THINGS LIVING TOGETHER AND THAT IS HOW THE DISEASE WAS SPREAD CASE TWO DOESNT AS CLEARLY SHOW THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE FED THE SAME THING BUT NOT ALL CONTRACT THE DISEASE THE REASON THEY DONT CONTRACT THE DISEASE IS THE DIET IS ALREADY CONTAMINATED HENCE THE DISEASE WOULD HAVE TO BE BACTERIUM VIRUS TO SPREAD WHICH IT IS NOT THE DISEASE CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CLEANLINESS GERMS OR GENETICS IT IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY THAT CAUSES THE DISEASE TO COME INTO THEIR SYSTEM WHEN THEY ARE LACKING SOMETHING	224	THE 11 MEN WERE FED VERY POORLY LACKING NUTRIENTS AND VITAMINS ALTHOUGH THEY LIVED IN A SANITARY PLACE THEY CAN STILL DEVELOP THE DISEASE IF THEY EAT A WELL BALANCED MEAL THEIR BODIES WOULD BUILD AN IMMUNITY TO DISEASE THEYRE LESS LIKELY TO GET ILL ALTHOUGH THE 20 MEN WHO LIVED AN UNSANITARY PLACE THEY HAD A HEALTHY DIET THEYRE DIET CONSISTS OF ALL THE NUTRIENTS NEEDED THEIR BODY TO FUNCTION WHEN THEIR BODY ALL WORKED TOGETHER THEY BUILD IMMUNITY TO CERTAIN DISEASES THEYRE LESS LIKELY TO BE ILL THUS THE BODY WOULD FUNCTION AND GET STRONGER WHEN IT HAS THE NUTRIENTS IT NEEDS WITH THE STRENGTH IT FIGHT OFF DISEASES A POOR DIET WILL RESULT IN SICKNESS AND DISEASES THE BODY DOESNT HAVE ENOUGH NUTRIENTS TO FUNCTION REGULARLY AND PROPERLY THEREFORE IT IS TOO WEAK TO FIGHT THE DISEASE	225	THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE IS A BACTERIA EACH STUDY SUPPLIED DATA THE BUILD THE CASE STUDY 1 SIMPLY DESCRIBED THAT DISEASED PEOPLE TEND TO LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RELATED EVEN THOSE LIVING NEXT DOOR COULD HAVE BEEN RELATIVES BUT A DISEASE CAUSED BY A BACTERIA WOULD AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE NEARBY IN THESE VILLAGES IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN 1912 PEOPLE PROBABLY DIDNT TRAVEL FAR IF THEY GOT INFECTED BY A BACTERIUM IT WAS FROM A NEIGHBOR OR PEOPLE LIVING WITH THEM THE STUDY DID NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS GENETICS IN OTHER WORDS IT DID NOT RULE OUT A GENETIC CAUSE PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR COULD BE RELATIVES WITH SAME GENETIC MAKES UP STUDIES 2 AND 3 SET UP EXPERIMENTS STUDY 2 TRIED TO ISOLATE THE DISEASE CAUSING BACTERIUM FROM PATIENTS OR THE FOOD THEY ATE OF THE NINE BACTERIA HE EXPOSED CHICKENS TO THE RESEARCHER WAS ABLE TO MAKE ONE CHICKEN SICK LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY ARE 1 CHICKENS MAY REACT DIFFERENTLY TO BACTERIA THAN HUMANS 2 ONLY ONE CHICKEN WAS FED CORN WITH THIS BACTERIA AND 3 THE BACTERIA MAY HAVE BLOCKED SOME OF THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE CORN SUGGESTING THAT THE DISEASE IS ACTUALLY A NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY STUDY 3 FOCUSED ON DIET AND HYGIENE OVER HALF THE MEN IN THE STUDY CAME DOWN WITH THE DISEASE BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS BECAUSE THE STUDY MIXED POOR DIET WITH OPPORTUNITY FOR DISEASE TO BE PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POOR DIET MAKES PEOPLE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A BACTERIA AND THAT ONCE ITS IN A POPULATION IT SPREADS THE GROUP OF MEN WHO WERE FED THE POOR DIET WERE ISOLATED FROM OUTSIDERS STUDY IGNORED GENETICS ALTOGETHER	226	THE WAY THAT THE DISEASE WAS TRANSMITTED IN THE SECOND STUDY SHOWS THAT THE DISEASE IS ONE THAT CAN LIVE ON FOOD UNTIL IT FINDS A HOST THIS IS TOTALLY BACTERIA LIVING WITH PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN DIRTY HOMES IS A SWELL WAY TO PICK UP A VIRUS ALL A VIRUS WANTS IS A HOST SO I SEE THIS SITUATION AS A TRAVELING BUG	227	I BELIEVE DISEASE X IS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IN BOTH CHICKENS AND IN HUMANS A POOR DIET WAS GIVEN THUS RESULTING IN SICK PEOPLE FROM JUST THE CHICKENS ONE DOESNT GET THE COMPLETE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH DIET ESPECIALLY ONLY AFTER READING THE STUDY AT FIRST IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT COULD BE A BACTERIUM VIRUS ONLY AFTER THE MALE STUDY DOES IT SHOW THAT AN IMPROPER DIET IS THE REASON FOR SICKNESS ONLY LIVING OFF UNHEALTHY FOODS FOR SIX MONTHS CAUSED 6 OUT OF 11 MALES TO BE SICK WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF IF IT WERE A VIRUS BACTERIUM EVEN MORE WOULD HAVE THIS SICKNESS BUT ONE MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE COMPLETE CLEANNESS OF NOT ONLY THE HOUSE BUT ALSO THE BODY AND THESE 11 MEN COULDNT HAVE CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO NOBODY WAS CARRYING ANYTHING BACK IF IT WERE A VIRUS BACTERIUM THE 20 MEN LIVING IN THE OTHER HOUSE WOULD BE MORE PRONE TO CATCHING THIS SICKNESS AS THEY DID NOT LIVE IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT NOR DID THEY FOLLOW PROPER HYGIENE REGIMENTS SHOWERING WASHING CLOTHES THESE MEN WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE THEREFORE BEING ABLE TO CARRY SOMETHING HOME FROM THE OUTSIDE	228	I CAME UP WITH THAT IT IS THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY THAT IS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X I ARRIVED AT THIS ANSWER BY LOOKING AT THE DATA AND DOING A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY SHOWED THAT PEOPLE THAT LIVED AROUND THE SAME AREA HAD IT BUT NOT ALL OF THEM LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH THIS INFORMATION I ELIMINATED THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING A BACTERIUM VIRUS IF IT WAS A VIRUS OR BACTERIUM THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH A COUGH OR SNEEZE AND IT WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY FOR SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE TO GET DISEASE X ACCORDING TO THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X DID NOT LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE I ALSO FOUND THE STUDY THAT THIRD DOCTOR CAME UP WITH USEFUL I FOUND THIS USEFUL BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW THEY WERE ALL HEALTHY AND HOW NONE OF THE 20 MEN WITH A RICH DIET GOT SICK IT ALSO SHOWS HOW NONE OF THE 11 MEN GOT SICK UNTIL THEY WERE GIVEN A POOR DIET WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN THE POOR DIET 6 OUT THE 11 WERE DIAGNOSED WITH DISEASE X THE SECOND STUDY WAS ALSO SLIGHTLY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE CHICKEN WAS HEALTHY HE DID NOT GET SICK UNTIL AFTER HE ATE THE CONTAMINATED FOOD AND HE RETURNED BACK TO HEALTHY WHEN FED A NON CONTAMINATED DIET	229	ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS THE DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE FIRST STUDY SHOWS DISEASED INDIVIDUALS HAD CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM BUT THIS STUDYS RESULTS ARE WEAK IT CAN BE ANYTHING THE DOCTOR 1 DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HEALTHY THE PROVIDED INFORMATION HOWEVER CAN BE PREDICT THE CAUSE AS BACTERIUM VIRUS THE SECOND EXPERIMENT REVEALS THAT BACTERIA FROM FOOD CAUSED AN EXPERIMENTAL CHICKEN TO BE SICK BUT THE BACTERIA IS ORIGINATED FROM FOOD THE THIRD FINDINGS ARE THAT THE SIGNS OF DISEASE X SHOWED IN PEOPLE WHO HAD POOR DIET ALTHOUGH THEY LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE BUT HAD CONTACT WITH THE OTHER CONTROLLED GROUP WHO LIVED IN DIRTY HOUSE	230	IN STUDY ONE I CHOSE 1 GENETIC 2 INFECTIOUS AND 3 DIETARY AS POSSIBILITIES IN STUDY TWO I CHOSE 1 GENETIC 2 INFECTIOUS AND 3 DIETARY AS POSSIBILITIES IN STUDY THREE I CHOSE 2 INFECTIOUS OR 3 DIETARY AS POSSIBILITIES I EXCLUDED GENETIC B C IM ASSUMING THE 31 MEN IN THE STUDY WERE HEALTHY BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT STARTED THEREFORE IM DOWN TO TWO POSSIBILITIES 1 INFECTIOUS AND 2 DIETARY IN EXPLORING STUDY 1 I CANNOT FIND EVIDENCE THAT LEANS TOWARD INFECTIOUS OR DIETARY B C THE STUDY DID NOT MENTION ANY FOODS EATEN IN EXPLORING STUDY 3 DIETARY APPEARS TO BE THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE B C THE DISEASED GROUP LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE AND ATE A POOR DIET	231	FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURVEY I THINK THE DISEASE X IS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS IN THE FIRST STUDY DATA SHOWS THAT THE EFFECTED PEOPLE GOT THE FROM BACTERIUM VIRUS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO OTHER AFFECTED PEOPLE LIVING EITHER IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH THEM OR ELSEWHERE IF THE DISEASE X WERE GENETICALLY TRANSMITTED I DONT SEE ANY REASON WHY SOMEONE CAN GET IT FROM NEIGHBOR NEXT DOOR IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THAT AFFECTED PEOPLE RELATIVES OR LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE COULD PASS ON THE DISEASE X TO OTHER PEOPLE VIA A GERM FURTHERMORE DOCTOR 2S STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT THE DISEASE X COULD THE CAUSE OF BACTERIA IN HIS STUDY ONE 5 CHICKEN OF THE NINE HEALTHY CHICKENS GOT THE DISEASE X OBJECTIVELY WHY THE OTHER NINE WHO WERE ALSO EXPOSED TO BACTERIA DID DEVELOP THE DISEASE TO MY OPINION THERE MIGHT SOME OTHER REASON WHY THEY DID GET THE DISEASE IT COULD BE THAT THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM COULD ALLOW THEM BE RESISTIBLE FROM GETTING THE DISEASE	232	THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WOULD BE DIETARY DEFICIENCY WHEN WE LOOK AT DOCTOR 2S STUDY WE CAN NARROW DOWN OUR CHOICES TO BACTERIUM VIRUS AND DIETARY DEFICIENCY WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION DOCTOR 3S STUDY WE CAN BETTER DETERMINE THAT THIS DISEASE WAS CAUSED FROM DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY NONE OF THE MEN WHOSE DIET WAS HEALTHY EVEN THOUGH THEIR ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT CLEAN GOT THE DISEASE THE MEN WHO EAT POOR DIET OF MEAT EGGS GREEN VEGETABLE AND FRUIT DID NOT GET THE DISEASE UNTIL THEY STARTED ON THE POOR DIET OF WHEAT FLOUR CORNMEAL GRITS CORN STARCH WHITE RICE SUGAR ETC THIS LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THIS DISEASE IS LINKED TO A DIET THAT IS POOR IN PROTEIN AND RICH IN CARBOHYDRATES AND FATS	233	I THINK THAT DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY A DEFICIENCY IN DIET BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE FIRST STUDY HAD THE DISEASE AND HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE OTHERS AFFECTED THERE COULDNT BE A GENETIC LINK UNLESS THEY WERE ALL RELATED SOMEHOW ALSO IN THE THIRD STUDY THERE WERE A FEW MEN NOT AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE WHO HAD EATEN THE SAME DIET YET WERE LIVING IN CLEANER QUARTERS THE AMOUNT OF BACTERIA AROUND THEM HAD NO EFFECT ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY GOT DISEASE X SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FOOD	234	IN ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS DIETARY DEFICIENCY SEEMED LIKE IT AT LEAST COULD HAVE BEEN A POSSIBILITY GIVEN DOCTORS 2 AND 3S STUDIES DIETARY DEFICIENCY SEEMED THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE IN THESE 2 LAST STUDIES IT WAS PRESENTED AS THE MOST LOGICAL CAUSE THEREFORE IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT DISEASE X IS AT LEAST RELATED TO DIETARY DEFICIENCY	235	I FEEL THAT STUDIES ONE AND TWO HAVE A SIMILAR HYPOTHESIS BY REVIEWING THE DATA I THINK THIS DISEASE IS A BACTERIUM BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS WHO HAD THE DISEASE WERE IN CLOSE CONTACT THE FIRST TWO STUDIES SUGGEST THIS BECAUSE IT WAS LINKED TO EITHER CLOSE CONTACT OR POSSIBLY FOOD CONTAMINATION THE THIRD STUDY STILL SUGGESTS THIS HYPOTHESIS BECAUSE THE TEST SUBJECTS THAT WERE INFECTED LIVED TOGETHER I SEE A PATTERN WERE THIS DISEASE IS CONTAGIOUS THE REASON I ELIMINATED THE GENETIC HYPOTHESIS IS BECAUSE IN STUDY THREE NONE OF THE MEN WERE RELATED YET THEY ALL CARRIED THE DISEASE IN STUDY ONE 56 OF PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X WERE LIVING NEXT TO SOMEONE WITH IT ALSO THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT ISNT HEREDITARY	236	WELL ON THE FIRST CASE STUDY WE CAN SEE THAT IT IS CAUSED BY CONTACT BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY ONE THAT HAS THE DISEASE HAD CONTACT OR RELATIVE WHO HAD THE DISEASE ON THE SECOND CASE STUDY WE CAN SEE THAT ALL OF THE CHICKENS WERE FINE EXCEPT CHICKEN 5 SO THIS TELLS ME THAT THIS CHICKEN IS MISSING SOMETHING THAT IT NEEDS ON THE THIRD STUDY CASE IT SEEMS LIKE ITS DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSE THEY ARE MISSING SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED NOW I DONT KNOW WHY THE FIRST CASE STUDY DIFFERS FROM THE OTHER TWO BUT I CHOOSE DIETARY DEFICIENCY	237	I BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER WAS DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE 11 MEN THAT CONTRACTED THE DISEASE HAD A POOR DIET MEANING THEY WERE MISSING THE FOODS THEY NEED AND WAS ESSENTIAL TO THEIR BODIES THE OTHER MEN THAT WAS EATING MEATS AND EGGS ETC HAD NO SIGNS OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE THEY WERE MEETING THEIR BODIES NEEDS BUT THE OTHER MEN WASNT	238	IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT 64 WITH X LIVED NEXT DOOR TO PERSON WITH DISEASE IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT THE CHICKEN GOT SICK RELATED TO ITS DIET IN THE THIRD EXPERIMENT ALSO GOT THE DISEASE RELATED WITH A POOR DIET AND ALSO THE DISEASE IS CURABLE ALL THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW SOME IMPROVEMENT IN A DIFFERENT WAYS THEREFORE THE DISEASE CAN BE BOTH GENETIC AND BACTERIUM	239	ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH OF THREE DOCTOR THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE REASON SHOW CLEARLY IS THE RESEARCH RESULT OF DOCTOR NUMBER 3 AND THE OTHER TWO DOCTOR RESEARCH ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO PASS THE DISEASE ON BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY THEREFORE I THINK THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY HAVE A BIG CHANCE TO BE LIKELY CAUSE THE DISEASE	240	I THINK THE ANSWER TO NUMBER 4 IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THE THIRD DOCTOR YIELDED THE MOST CONVINCING RESULTS THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN DIET AND DISEASE THEREFORE I FEEL THAT THE THIRD DOCTOR IS ON TO SOMETHING	241	I BELIEVE THAT BACTERIUM AND VIRUS IS MOST LIKELY TO HAVE CAUSED THE DISEASES BECAUSE IN DOCTOR STUDY 2 THE ONLY THING THAT GOT THE CHICKENS SICK WAS THE CONTAMINATION OF CORNMEAL TO THE CHICKENS ALSO I BELIEVE THAT ONCE CHICKEN NUMBER FIVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X THE DOCTOR GAVE THE CHICKEN NON CONTAMINATED CORN AND THE SYMPTOMS STARTED TO DISAPPEAR	242	I THINK THAT BACTERIUM VIRUS IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE IN THE FIRST STUDIES 80 OF THE 115 CASES WERE FOUND NEXT TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAD THE DISEASE WHO WAS EITHER IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEXT DOOR THERE FORE I THINK THAT THE DISEASE WAS CONTAGIOUS PROBABLY BY CONTACT SNEEZING COUGHING ETC FOR THE 2ND STUDY I THINK THE CHICKENS GOT THE DISEASE FROM CONTAMINATED FOOD THAT THEY ATE WHICH ALSO MAKES BACTERIUM MORE LIKELY	243	I THINK IT IS NUMBER 4 BECAUSE THE 11 PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE WAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE GOT SICK AFTER 5 MONTHS THE REASON THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY GROUP WHO GOT SICK IS BECAUSE THEY ATE POOR	244	I FEEL THAT THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE REASON BECAUSE ESPECIALLY ON THE THIRD STUDY ONLY THE MEN WITH THE POOR DIET GOT THE DISEASE X ALSO PEOPLE LIVING WITH OTHERS WITH THE DISEASE NEVER CONTRACTED THE DISEASE FROM SOMEONE ELSE THEY WERE ABLE TO LIVE NEAR OR WITH OTHERS THAT HAD THE DISEASE AND STILL BE FINE	245	DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE CAUSED OF THE DISEASE X BECAUSE STARTING FROM THE PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR TO THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE CHICKEN TO THE EXPERIMENT ON THE MEN IT CAME DOWN THAT IT HAD TO DO WITH POOR DIET	246	THE DISEASE IS PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON VIA GERM AND IS THEREFORE CONTAGIOUS THROUGH BLOOD WASTE COUGH SNEEZE CONTAMINATED FOOD ETC AS WE SEE IN STUDY 3 PROMISCUITY CAN SPREAD THE DISEASE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT DEVELOP THE DISEASE DUE TO CERTAIN RESISTANCE TO THE BACTERIUM VIRUS TO FIND THE ETIOLOGY OF THE DISEASE WE CAN REFER TO STUDY 3 WHERE IT IS SAID THERE WERE MANY FLEAS AND BEDBUGS IN THIS HOUSE THESE MEN DID NOT KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ESPECIALLY CLEAN AND THEY DID NOT TAKE BATHS VERY OFTEN THESE MEN WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE	247	DIETARY DEFICIENCY SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY WAY BECAUSE ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT ATE POOR DIETS GOT THIS DISEASE AND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO EXPLAIN IT EXCEPT FOR SURVEY 3 PLUS YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS IN CLASS LAST WEEK AND I REMEMBER ALL OF THE STATISTICS AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THEY ARE AT LEAST SIMILAR IS IT THAT NIACIN THAT YOU BROUGHT UP OR IS IT TOO MUCH OF OTHER BAD FOOD THAT THEY ATE	248	IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF DISEASE X BUT I THINK THAT THE MAIN CAUSE IS BACTERIUM OR VIRUSES AS SHOWN BY THE THREE STUDIES THERE WERE SEVERAL INSTANCES THAT LEAD ME TO THIS CONCLUSION IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY MOST OF THE INFECTED PEOPLE EITHER LIVED TOGETHER OR LIVED NEXT TO EACH OTHER WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS NEAR ONE ANOTHER THEIR GARBAGE WAS TAKEN OUT TOGETHER THEIR CHILDREN WOULD PLAY TOGETHER THEY WOULD SPEND TIME TOGETHER ETC THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE AND WERE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER THIS MEANS THAT A MOTHER COULD HAVE HELPED HER CHILD WHEN HE SCRAPED HIS KNEE THIS IS IN CONNECTION WITH DOCTOR 3S STUDY WHERE THE 11 PEOPLE LIVED TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE AND 5 OF THEM DEVELOPED DISEASE X THEY WERE ALSO IN CLOSE QUARTERS THEY SHARED THEY SAME THINGS FOOD WASTE AND WERE ALWAYS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT WITH OTHERS IF ONE PERSON SNEEZED NEAR ANOTHER PERSON IT CONTAMINATED THE AIR AROUND THEM FINALLY DOCTOR 2S STUDY WAS ABOUT THE GROWTH OF BACTERIA AND FEEDING IT IN CORNMEAL TO CHICKENS ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT SICK BUT THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WAS WITH CHICKENS AND MAYBE DISEASE X IS MORE EASILY CAUGHT OR MORE PROMINENT IN HUMANS NONETHELESS IT DID SHOW UP AND WHEN THE INFECTED FOOD WAS STOPPED THE SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY	249	BASES ON THE INFORMATION GIVEN FROM STUDY 3 PATIENTS WITH DISEASE X DID NOT HAVE THE DISEASE UNTIL THEY LIVED TOGETHER AND HAD A POOR DIET SINCE THE HOUSE WAS KEPT CLEAN WE CAN RULE OUT THE HOUSE AS A CAUSE SINCE 6 OUT OF THE 11 MAN WHO HAD A POOR DIET HAD THE DISEASE IT RELATES TO DIETARY DEFICIENCY CASE STUDY 2 SHOWS THAT DISEASE X IS OBTAINABLE BY BACTERIA GIVEN THROUGH THE FOOD AND IN CASE STUDY 1 DISEASE X IS SEEN MORE THROUGH PEOPLE WHO LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS DISEASE X OR NEXT DOOR TO SOMEONE WHO HAD THE DISEASE OR HAD CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD THE DISEASE BASED ON ALL THOSE INFORMATION ITS SAFE TO SAY THAT DISEASE X IS A BACTERIA VIRUS	250	I CONSIDER DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IN ALL THE CASES THE DISEASE WAS PRESENTED WHEN THERE WAS AN IMBALANCE IN THE DIETARY MEALS IT IS LIKE GERMS VIRUSES AND BACTERIA ARE PRESENT IN EVERY DAY LIFE HOWEVER SOME OF THESE BACTERIA FOR EXAMPLE GET HIGHER LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN GROUPS OR COMMUNITIES DEPENDING ON THE RIGHT CONDITION FOR THIS BACTERIA TO DEVELOP AND GET SPREAD THROUGH SOME MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WHO HAVE THE SAME OR SIMILAR DIETARY BALANCE AND THAT ARE IN CLOSE CONTACT TO EACH OTHER THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM WHO HAS ALMOST THE SAME CONDITIONS DIET AND ALSO LIVE IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET THE DISEASE THIS DISEASE X APPEAR WHEN THE DIET WAS CHANGE PRODUCING AN UNBALANCE IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH CONTRIBUTE WITH THE DEVELOP AND GROWTH OF THIS DISEASE POOR DIETARY SYSTEM LOW DEFENSES IN IMMUNE SYSTEM SAME HABITAT AND ALSO ISOLATED FROM A HABITAT WHICH HAS DIFFERENT KINDS OF ORGANISMS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN DEVELOP RESISTANCE CREATING IMMUNIZATION AGAINST SOME BACTERIA THIS ISOLATION HELPED THE BACTERIA TO FIND A LOW IMMUNE SYSTEM	251	I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS MOSTLY LIKELY BACTERIUM FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS I BELIEVE LIKE THE SECOND DOCTOR THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIA FOUND ON IN CERTAIN FOODS SUCH AS SOMETHING FOUND IN A POOR DIET FIRST THE SECOND DOCTOR PERFORMED AN EXPERIMENT ON CHICKENS USING BACTERIA FROM THE FOOD AND BLOOD OF PEOPLE WHO HAD DISEASE X THE CHICKENS ATE A SIMILAR DIET AND ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT SICK WHEN THE CHICKEN ATE NON CONTAMINATED CORN IT BECAME HEALTHY AGAIN ALL NINE CHICKENS WERE EATING DIFFERENT BACTERIA THE ONE THAT GOT SICK MORE THAN LIKELY WAS CONSUMING THE BACTERIA THE THIRD DOCTOR ALSO TESTING DIETARY CONNECTION TO THE DISEASE ALSO EXTRACTED EVIDENCE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS THEORY THE MEN WERE ALL LIVING IN A SANITARY ENVIRONMENT NO ONE COULD COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND NO ONE HAD THE DISEASE IN THEIR FAMILY FOR HALF THE POPULATION LIVING IN THIS HOUSE TO HAVE THE DISEASE POINTS TO THE DIET THE MEN WHO GOT THE DISEASE WERE EATING MORE OF THE FOOD THAT WAS CONTAMINATED WITH THE BACTERIA BY CONSUMING LARGER AMOUNTS OF THE BACTERIA THE MEN GOT THE DISEASE FASTER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME AREA PROBABLY GOT FOOD IN THE SAME PLACE IF A CERTAIN FOOD WAS CONTAMINATED BY THE BACTERIA AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE FIRST DOCTORS DISEASED POPULATION HAD CONSUMED THIS FOOD THIS COULD BE THE CAUSE	252	WELL THE BACTERIUM VIRUS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE THIS IS SO BECAUSE IN ALL THE STUDIES GERMS WERE ALWAYS INVOLVED EITHER IT WAS THROUGH BACTERIA ON FOOD OR IT GERMS PASSED THROUGH TOUCH OR SNEEZE IN STUDY 1 PEOPLE IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD ATTRACTED THE DISEASE AND THEY ARE ALWAYS IN CONTACT AND NEIGHBORS ALSO ATTRACTED THE DISEASE WITH EACH OTHER SO ITS PROBABLY A FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD STUDY 2 SHOWS A CHICKEN WITH THE DISEASE THROUGH THE FOOD IT ATE OBVIOUSLY THE DISEASE IS PRESENT IN FOOD AND IF YOU EAT IT YOU WILL GET IT AS THE CHICKEN DID I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN PART THREE MAYBE THE DISEASE IS IN FOOD IN A BAD DIET SO IT IS PASSED BOTH WAY THROUGH A BAD DIET AND THE UN HEALTHY FOOD EATEN EVERY BODY EITHER HAD CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER OR ATE SOME BAD FOOD CAUSING IT TO BE PASSED THROUGH GERMS	253	I BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS FROM THE INFORMATION I WAS GIVEN IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WAS VERY LIKELY TO BE A BACTERIUM BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE SAME PLACE HAD THE DISEASE SUCH AS A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY I ALSO THOUGHT IT COULD BE A BACTERIUM BECAUSE THE 11 PEOPLE WERE ALL IN THE SAME LIVING QUARTERS WHICH IS AN IDEAL PLACE FOR A BACTERIUM TO SURVIVE THE BACTERIUM COULD HAVE INFECTED ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE AND TOOK A WHILE FOR IT TO PROGRESS SUCH AS THE 5 MONTHS EXPLAINED IN THE STUDY IF THE BACTERIUM WERE TO START QUICKLY AND KILL THE INFECTED PERSON THEN IT WOULD BE NO HELP TO THE BACTERIA BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN DIE TOO THE BACTERIA JOB IS TO INFECT PEOPLE AND TO GET WHAT IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE DOCTOR 2S STUDY WAS NOT HELPFUL ONE BIT TO MY CONCLUSION HOW EVER THE DISEASE COULD BE DIFFERENT IN THE SPECIES SO THEREFORE THE INFORMATION COULD NOT BE HELPFUL DISEASE X MUST THEREFORE BE CAUSE BY A BACTERIA AND INFECT HUMANS AT A FASTER RATE THAN OTHER ANIMALS	254	THE DISEASE WAS NOT PICKED UP BY EVERYONE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR EVERYONE THAT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X SO IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN VIRAL OR AIR BORN NINE CHICKENS WERE GIVEN THE BACTERIA IN STERILIZED CORNMEAL BUT NONE OF THEM DEVELOP THIS DISEASE UNTIL THEIR DIET WERE CHANGED THEN OVER TIME ONE OF THE NINE CHICKEN DEVELOP THE DISEASE THIS LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS CHICKEN WHO HAD THE SAME DIET THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THE OTHERS DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THIS CHICKEN HAD A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL SO I WOULD SAY THIS DISEASE IS CAUSE FROM BACTERIA	255	THE REASON THAT I CHOOSE THE ANSWER BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MUCH EASIER TO GET AFFECT BY OTHER PERSON WHO ARE MOSTLY NEAR TO FOR EXAMPLE FROM DOCTOR 1S STUDY THERE ARE 115 PEOPLE WHO GOT DISEASE X THEY ARE 92 OUT OF 115 PEOPLE WHO GOT DISEASE X AND THEY WERE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR THEY HAD CONTACTED TO EACH OTHER VERY OFTEN AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD COST THE PROBLEMS BEGIN THOSE PROBLEMS MAY COME FROM FOOD BLOOD WASTE CONTACT COUGH AND SNEEZE THEREFORE IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO HAVE DISEASE X FROM PERSON TO PERSON	256	FROM DOCTOR 1S STUDY WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISEASE X ARE IN THE SAME HOUSE OR FROM THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD AND SOME OF THEM SAID THAT THEY HAD CONTACT WITH RELATIVES WHO HAD DISEASE X FROM THIS INFORMATION I THINK THAT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE TOGETHER OR NEARBY THEY MIGHT EAT THE SAME CONTAMINATE FOOD AFTER THEY HAD DISEASE X THEY PASS IT BY WASTE CONTACT COUGH SNEEZE BLOOD ETC MOREOVER FROM DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE SICK CHICKEN ATE THE CONTAMINATE FOOD WITH THE TYPE5 BACTERIA THEREFORE THAT CHICKEN IS SICK ALTHOUGH ALL THE CHICKEN ATE THE SAME KIND OF BACTERIA YET NOT EVERY CHICKEN IS SICK I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE TYPES OF BACTERIA ARE DIFFERENT THE OTHER TYPES OF BACTERIA MAY NOT AFFECT ON THE CHICKEN BUT THE TYPE 5 WILL	257	I THINK BACTERIUM AND VIRUS IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS EXPERIMENT BY PUTTING TWO GROUP OF MEN AGED 24 TO 50 YEARS OLD IN TWO DIFFERENT CONDITION HOUSE THE 11 MEN WHO AGREE TO EAT THE POOR DIET ALSO AGREED TO LIVE TOGETHER IN A LARGE HOUSE DURING THE EXPERIMENT IT WAS KEPT VERY CLEAN BY CLEAN STAFF THE MEN WERE GIVING CLEAN CLOTHES EACH WEEK AND THEY WERE MADE TO TAKE BATH THREE TIMES A WEEK NO FLEAS OR BEDBUGS THESE MEN STAY AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE DURING THE SIX MONTH ON THE CONTRARY 20 MEN WHO ATE REGULAR DIET LIVED IN A DIFFERENT LARGE HOUSE BUT IT WAS NOT KEPT ESPECIALLY CLEAN AND THERE WERE MANY FLEAS AND BEDBUGS IN THIS HOUSE THE MEN DID NOT KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ESPECIALLY CLEAN AND THEY DID NOT TAKE BATHS VERY OFTEN ALLOWED TO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE THROUGH TO THE DOCTOR 3S STUDY I CAN SEE CLEARLY IF PEOPLE EAT POOR DIET FOOD PEOPLE HAVE NOT ENOUGH NUTRIENT TO KEEP THE BODY IN HEALTHY FROM THIS THE ENERGY IN OUR BODY NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFENSE WITH OTHER DISEASE MIGHT ATTACK THEREFORE THOSE DISEASES HAVE A CHANCE TO INVADE OUR BODY BECAUSE AT THIS TIME OUR BODY IS VERY WEAK SO THEY MIGHT ATTACK EASILY AND DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE LIKE 6 OF 11 VOLUNTEER WHO ATE THE POOR DIET EVEN THOSE MEN LIVE IN A GOOD CONDITION WITH CLEAN CLOTHES AND LIVE IN A CLEAN HOUSE BUT DISEASE STILL DEVELOP SYMPTOM THEREFORE PEOPLE SHOULD EAT REGULAR DIET WITH SOME MEAT EGGS MILK GREEN VEGETABLES AND FRUIT YOU MIGHT STAY AWAY FROM DISEASE FOOD IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY PROVIDE TO THE PEOPLE A GOOD ENERGY TO SUPPORT OUR BODY AND PROTECT THE OUR BODY FROM DISEASE BY EATING WELL EXERCISES REGULARLY OUR BODY WILL HAVE MORE STRENGTH TO PUSH AND DEFENSE ANY DISEASE IF WE HAVE A STRENGTH NO MATTER WHAT IS CONDITION YOU ARE LIVING IN YOU ARE STILL BETTER THAN THOSE PEOPLE WHO EAT A POOR DIET	258	FIRST OF 115 WHO HAD DISEASE X 64 LIVED NEXT DOOR TO PEOPLE WHO HAD DISEASE X PROXIMITY OF SOME FORM OF CONTACT SUCH AS SHARING HOUSEHOLD WARES OR FOOD IS THE MODE OF TRANSMISSION 28 OF PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE THEY HAVE CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER 7 RELATIVES WITH DISEASE X MUST HAVE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER PASSING VIRUS BACTERIA TO ONE ANOTHER	259	BACTERIUM VIRUS CAN ONLY BE PASSED ON FROM PERSON TO PERSON THROUGH CONTACT LIVING IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT CAUSED DISEASE X TO BE PASSED ON TO 64 PEOPLE LIVING NEXT TO EACH OTHER THROUGH CONTACT	260	ACCORDING TO THE STUDY 1 THE PEOPLE DIDNT GET ANY SPECIAL DIET EVERY BODY GOT HIS OWN DIET AND I THINK THAT THE ATMOSPHERE HAD AN EFFECT SPECIALLY THAT ALL OF THEM ARE IN THE SAME COUNTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA THEY COULD BE AFFECTED BY USING PUBLIC PLACES OR EATING SAME KIND OF MEAT THAT IT HAS A TRANSFER BACTERIA	261	DOCTOR 3S STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE ELEVEN MEN WHO LIVED IN THE CLEAN HOUSE HAD NO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE SO IT WAS NOT A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS DISEASE THESE MEN ATE A POOR DIET THAT WAS ONLY RICH IN CARBOHYDRATES AND LACKING IN PROTEINS IT SHOWS THAT A LACK OF PROTEINS IS A LIKELY CAUSE IT CANNOT BE A GENETIC DISEASE BECAUSE IN ALL THE STUDIES THE PEOPLE AND CHICKENS ARE NOT RELATED THERE ISNT A MODEL THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA PROVIDED IN ALL THE STUDIES	262	I BELIEVE THAT ITS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE OF THE STUDIES THAT DOCTORS 2 AND 3 DID DOCTOR 2 GROUND DRIED AND SHELLED THE CORN IN SOME BOTTLES HE WATERED AND STERILIZED THEM BUT ONE BOTTLE WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED SWEETENED AND STERILE THEY ALL RECEIVED THE SAME AMOUNTS OF BACTERIA BUT ONLY ONE CHICKEN WAS SICK IT HAD BEEN DEPRIVED A DIETARY NEED BUT WHEN IT HAD BEEN FED WITH NON CONTAMINATED CORN IN DOCTOR 3S EXPERIMENT THE 20 MN WHO ATE RICH DIETS BUT LIVED POORLY DID NOT COME UP WITH THE DISEASE AS OPPOSED TO THE 11 MEN WHO ATE POORLY AND 6 OF THEM GOT DISEASED THIS LED ME TO THINK THAT IT WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IT CANT BE A GENETIC DISEASE BECAUSE ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON IN EXPERIMENT THREE THERE ARE ALL MEN AND DOESNT STATE WHETHER THEY ARE RELATED THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE CHICKENS AND THERE IS NO CROSS IT CANT BE BACTERIA BECAUSE IN EXPERIMENT 3 THE 20 MEN LIVED IN DIRTY CONDITIONS AND HAD CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE HAD THE DISEASE OR NOT ITS NOT STATED	263	I THINK THAT DISEASE CAUSED BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE REASON IS THE DOCTORS RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT CHICKENS AND THE MEN WHO WERE FED THE GOD QUALITY OF FOOD DID NOT SHOW THE ANY SIGNS OF DISEASE THERE CAN BE ANOTHER REASON THAT FOOD WAS NOT CONTAMINATED BUT ALSO DIDNT CARRY ALL IMPORTANT THINGS OF GOOD DIET	264	I THINK THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE AFTER READING DOCTOR 2S STUDY IT SEEMED THE MOST VIABLE HIS FINDINGS SHOWED THAT ONCE THE CHICKEN WAS FED THE BACTERIA CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL THE CHICKEN IMMEDIATELY BECAME SICK BUT ONCE THE DIET WAS CHANGED TO NON CONTAMINATED CORN THE CHICKENS HEALTH IMPROVED THIS WOULD MEAN THAT AFTER THE CHICKENS HEALTH IMPROVED COMPLETELY THE DOCTOR COULD FEED THE CONTAMINATED CORN TO THE CHICKEN AGAIN AND IT WOULD BECOME SICK THIS SHOWS THE REASON WHY SYMPTOMS WOULD APPEAR IN A PATIENT THEN LATER RETURN IN A PATIENTS LIFE THIS ONE POINT IS WHAT MADE ME FEEL THAT THE DISEASE WAS BACTERIUM VIRUS I DID NOT FEEL THAT DOCTOR 1S STUDY FIT THE CASE VERY WELL BECAUSE HIS OPINION WAS THAT THOSE THAT WERE IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD THE DISEASE X SEEMED TO CONTRACT IT HOWEVER IF THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALWAYS COMING IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER THEN THE DISEASE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO AWAY SINCE THEY WOULD BE GIVING IT BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER I DID NOT FEEL THAT DOCTOR 2S STUDY FIT THE CASE VERY WELL BECAUSE HIS OPINION WAS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE FED A POOR DIET SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X APPEARED THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ONCE THE PEOPLE ARE CONTINUOUSLY FED A HEALTHY DIET THE HEALTH WOULD IMPROVE IF THOSE THAT WERE INFECTED WITH THE DISEASE IN THE CASE WERE ALWAYS EATING A POOR DIET THEN THEIR HEALTH SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE SINCE THEIR DIET DOES NOT CHANGE THAT IS UNLESS THEY WERE TO ALL HAVE GOTTEN RICH AND COULD EAT MORE NUTRITIOUS FOOD	265	IN MY OPINION THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IN STUDY 3 THERE WAS MORE EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE RECEIVING THE DISEASE X IN BOTH STUDIES 2 AND 3 THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION OF HOW THE DISEASE WAS CARRIED FORWARD IN STUDY 2 ONLY ONE OF THE CHICKENS OUT OF THE NINE RECEIVED THE DISEASE THROUGH BACTERIA IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT SOMEONE WILL RECEIVE THE DISEASE IN STUDY 3 NEARLY HALF OF THE 11 MEN THAT FOLLOWED THE POOR DIET RECEIVED THE DISEASE THE 20 MEN WHO FOLLOWED A HEALTHY DIET BUT WERE EXPOSED TO BACTERIA NEVER RECEIVED THE DISEASE THIS PROVES THAT BACTERIA IS LESS LIKELY AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE IS CARRIED THROUGH LACK OF NUTRITION ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT IF THESE MEN WERE EXPOSED TO BACTERIA THE WAY THE CHICKENS WERE IT MAY BE LESS LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE SHOWS BECAUSE HUMANS OF COURSE HAVE STRONGER IMMUNITY THAN CHICKENS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN STUDY 1 IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS BECAUSE IT DIDNT GIVE ME ENOUGH SOLID INFORMATION THE WAY STUDY 2 AND 3 DID	266	I BELIEVE ITS DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE OF THE DATA GIVEN THE STUDY OF DOCTOR 1 GIVES US QUITE USELESS DATA THEREFORE CONSIDERING THE STUDIES OF DOCTORS 2 AND 3 I CONCLUDED THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY DOCTOR 2S STUDY NARROWS THE CAUSE DOWN TO BACTERIUM AND VIRUS HIS STUDY USED BLOOD HOWEVER HE USED CHICKENS DOCTOR 3 CONCENTRATED ON DIET AND HE USED HUMANS SO I WENT WITH DOCTOR 3	267	THE DISEASE WOULD BE MORE OF A GENETIC PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE THROUGH GERMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR AND FOR THE PEOPLE GETTING THE DISEASE THROUGH POOR DIET THE DIET CHOICE CAN BE A NON ISSUE BECAUSE IT CAN BE PREVENTED AND CONTROLLED IF THE INDIVIDUALS TAKE THE NECESSARY NUTRIENTS IN THEIR DIETS NOW THE ISSUE OF HAVING THE DISEASE THROUGH YOUR NEIGHBOR OR IN YOUR HOUSE RELATIVES CAN BE AVOIDED BUT TO KNOW IF YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS THE DISEASE OF YOU RELATIVE HOUSE DOESNT COME TO MIND IN A HUMAN IF A PERSON KNOWS THAT THE NEIGHBOR HAS THE DISEASE HE SHE WILL NOTICE IT ONLY AFTER HE SHE OR THEIR CHILD HAS THE DISEASE THIS IS KIND OF AN OPEN TOPIC FOR POSSIBILITIES THEREFORE I HAVENT CHOSEN THIS METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS NOW I HAVE CHOSEN THE GENETIC METHOD AS OUR TA MISS LEE SAID YOU CANT CONTROL WHAT GENE YOU GIVE THE CHILD OF THE AFFECTED PERSON WILL EITHER HAVE IT OR NOT EVEN IF FUTURE OFFSPRING THE DISEASE DOESNT SHOW UP IT WILL SHOW UP EVENTUALLY AND NOBODY CAN DO ANYTHING UNLESS A VACCINE MEDICINE PREVENTIVES ARE FOUND TO DESTROY DISEASE X OR KEEP IT AT A LEVEL THAT DOESNT ENDANGER THE PERSONS LIFE FOR THESE REASONS I HAVE CHOSEN THE GENETIC WAY OF TRANSPORTATION	268	PROM MY OBSERVATION THROUGH EACH OF DOCTORS STUDIED MY CONSIDERATION OF DISEASE X WOULD CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS AND THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY WHICH IS THE DISEASE IS PASSED FROM ONE PERSON THE ANOTHER VIA GERM VIRUS AND THROUGH CONTAMINATED FOOD PERHAPS THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN ONES DIET ALSO THE DISEASE IS AFFECTED BY LIVING NONE STERILIZED CONDITION SO THE VIRUS IS EASILY TRANSMIT TO ONE ANOTHER LIKELY THE FOOD THAT HAD PROVIDED AND THE WATER IS SHARING FORM THE SAME SOURCE	269	IF I WERE JUST TO TAKE A GUESS IT WOULD BE THAT THE BACTERIUM VIRUS CAUSED THE DISEASE SCIENTIFICALLY HOWEVER IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE IS THE EVIDENCE IN STUDY 2 SEEMS TO POINT TO A BACTERIAL CAUSE BUT THE WHOLE STUDY WAS FLAWED IN THAT THERE WERE A LACK OF CONTROL CHICKEN THAT WERE FED UNCONTAMINATED CORN MEAL THE EVIDENCE IN STUDY 3 SUGGESTS THAT A DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSED THE ILLNESS HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME FOOD PERHAPS THE CORN COULD HAVE HAD A PRIOR CONTAMINATION THUS THOUGH ALL THREE STUDIES WERE IN FACT NOT CONTROLLED WELL THE FRAGMENTS OF EVIDENCE DO POINT ALBEIT WEAKLY TO A BACTERIAL VIRUS INFECTION THAT COULD HAVE CONTAMINATED THE FOOD OR WATER STUDY 1 PEOPLE LIVING CLOSE TO EACH OTHER	270	STUDY 3 WAS THE BEST DESIGNED STUDY ALTHOUGH MANY CONTROLS WERE STILL LEFT OUT THIS STUDY INDICATES DIETARY DEFICIENCY DD IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH STUDIES 1 AND 2 AS WELL HOWEVER THEY ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OTHER CAUSES MY ANSWER IS SIMPLY A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION	271	THE SECOND STUDY INDICATES QUITE STRONGLY THAT THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE IS BACTERIAL VIRAL THE BASIC DIET OF ALL THE CHICKENS IS THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE ONES THAT RECEIVE BACTERIAL INOCULUMS WITH THEIR MEAL STRICTLY THIS STUDY DOES NOT PRECLUDE A GENETIC COMPONENT TO THE DISEASE HOWEVER STUDY ONE INDEPENDENTLY SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS NO GENETIC COMPONENT IN HUMANS SINCE RELATIVES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE DISEASED THAN HOUSEMATES OR EVEN NEIGHBORS THE LAST STUDY IS NOT VERY WELL CONTROLLED SINCE THERE ARE MULTIPLE VARIABLES DIFFERENT WITHIN EACH HOUSEHOLD OF MEN HOWEVER THE STUDY DOES INDICATE THAT DIET PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION THOSE MEN WITH A NUTRIENT RICH DIET ARE ABLE TO FIGHT OFF THE BACTERIAL VIRAL DISEASE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THOSE MEN WITH A POOR DIET THERE IS NO STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE SOURCE OF THE BACTERIAL VIRAL CONTAGION COMING OUT OF ANY OF THE STUDIES BUT BASED ON THE LAST STUDY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS COMING EITHER FROM THE SEWAGE SYSTEM OR FROM A SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THEIR DIET I E THE SWEET POTATOES OR COLLARDS	272	I THINK THAT THIS COULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN A BACTERIA THAT NEEDS A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM TO STRIKE WITH A HEALTHY PERSON EATING A HEALTHY DIET THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS BUT WITHOUT THE GOOD FOOD THERE IS A GREATER CHANCE OF THE PERSON DEVELOPING THE DISEASE THE THIRD STUDY HAD A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND THE SECOND STUDY WAS ONLY PERFORMED ONCE SO I THINK THAT BOTH OF THESE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT	273	THIS EXPERIMENT HAD TYPICAL FORMAT WITH A CONTROL GROUP IN THIS CASE WITH NORMAL DIET AND AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAT WAS EXPOSED TO THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE POOR DIET DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT DEVELOP ANY SYMPTOMS OR THE DISEASE X ITSELF AND THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DID IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT POOR DIET WOULD BE THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X	274	IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS OF SOME SORT IN THE FIRST CASE ALMOST ALL OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X HAD CONTACT WITH OR WERE NEAR OTHERS ALSO INFLICTED IN THE SECOND CASE STUDY THE CHICKEN THAT CONTINUOUSLY ATE A CERTAIN BACTERIA 5 WAS AFFLICTED BUT SEEMED TO BE BETTER AFTER THE BACTERIA WAS NO LONGER GIVEN TO THE CHICKEN	275	THE DISEASE CAUSED BY BACTERIA IS THE MOST LIKELY DISEASE BECAUSE IN THE DOCTORS STUDY HE EXPERIENCED THE EXPERIMENT CLEARLY AND MORE CONVINCIBLE MORE THE BACTERIA 5 IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAUSE DISEASE X	276	FIRST OFF I AM CONVINCED BY ALL THREE EXPLANATIONS FROM DIFFERENT SITUATION ARE ALL DIETARY PROBLEMS BECAUSE ITS ALL ABOUT EATING THAT AFFECTS THE PEOPLE THERES NO SIGN OF GENETIC THAT RESULT OF THIS DISEASE X HOWEVER THERE ARE CASE WITH BACTERIAL PROBLEM IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS MAINLY THEY TALKED ABOUT EATING PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY THAT BACTERIAL MIGHT CONTAINED IN THE FOOD TO CAUSE THIS RESULT	277	THE REASON I PICKED DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS BECAUSE OF THE CASE STUDY WITH THE MEN IN THE HOUSES THE MEN THAT HAD A GOOD DIET DID NOT DEVELOP DISEASE X IN CONTRAST THE 11 MEN THAT HAD THE POOR DIET 6 OUT OF 11 OF THEM SHOWED DISEASE X	278	I BELIEVE THAT DISEASE X IS BACTERIUM OR VIRUS BECAUSE OF THE FIRST TWO STUDIES IN THE FIRST STUDY IT IS SHOWN THAT THE DISEASE IS PRESENT AMONGST PEOPLE LIVING IN CLOSE CONTACT THE SECOND STUDY DEALS WITH DIET BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIMENT REVOLVES AROUND BACTERIA THE BACTERIA IS PRESENTED TO NINE TEST SAMPLES AND ONLY ONE DEVELOPS THE DISEASE SHOWING ME THAT IF IT WERE DIETARY THAN MORE OF THE STUDY WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THE LAST STUDY TRIES TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY THE POOR DIET BUT IF THAT WERE TRUE MORE THAN HALF OF THE TEST SAMPLE WOULD HAVE CONTACTED DISEASE X	279	I ARRIVE TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DIETARY IS THE MOSTLY LIKELY FACTOR CAUSING THE DISEASE BECAUSE SIX OUT OF ELEVEN MEN WHO AGREED TO EAT POOR DIET SHOW THE SYMPTOM OF THE DISEASE THEY LIVED IN A PLACID ENVIRONMENT AND STAYED AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE THEREFORE THE BACTERIA CAN NOT PASS THROUGH THEM BY DAILY CONTACT OR CONTAMINATED FOOD THE GENETIC ALSO CAN NOT BE THE ANSWER TO THE DISEASE X THIS IS BECAUSE THE BODY TESTS SHOW THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE THE DISEASE BEFORE THE ONLY SOLUTION IS DIETARY SIX OF THE PEOPLE GET THE DISEASE X I THINK BECAUSE THEIR HEALTHY ARE NOT VERY GOOD SO THE POOR DIET CAN LEAD TO THE DISEASE X	280	I CHECKED BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE IT WAS PROVEN TO BE THE CASE IN 1 AND 2 OF THE THREE STUDIES ALTHOUGH I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE BECAUSE IN STUDY NUMBER 3 A POOR DIET PROVED TO BE THE CAUSE BUT BECAUSE STUDY 1 AND 2 AGREED I CHOSE BACTERIUM VIRUS CAUSE ALTHOUGH STUDY THREE LOOKED TO BE THE MOST CLOSELY MONITORED I THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER TWO AGREED SO THERE WAS SO SUPPORT TO THE BACTERIUM VIRUS THEORY	281	I BELIEVE ITS BACTERIUM I BELIEVE THIS DO TO THE FACT THAT 2 OF THE DOCTORS CAME UP WITH THE SAME RESULT DOCTOR 2 CONVINCED ME THE MOST BECAUSE THE CHICKEN OF WHOM HE GAVE THE INFECTED CORNMEAL TO CAME UP WITH THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS A PERSON WOULD HAVE DOCTOR 1 ALSO SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD THE DISEASE COULD PASS IT ON TO OTHER PEOPLE OF WHO THEY WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO	282	IN CASE DOCTOR 1S STUDY THERE WAS NO REAL EVIDENCE OF A DIETARY DEFICIENCY AS THERE WAS IN DOCTOR 2 3S STUDIES BUT THERE IS NO STRONG EVIDENCE THAT DOCTOR 1S STUDY IS PURELY GENETIC DOCTOR 2 3S STUDIES BOTH KEPT STRICT DATA OF THE DIET THE SUBJECTS WERE CONSUMING DOCTOR 3S STUDY INCORPORATED CLEANLINESS OF LIVING QUARTERS SO I ALSO THOUGHT BACTERIUM VIRUS BUT THERE WAS MORE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE IN 2 OUT OF THE 3 STUDIES WHICH STRESSED EVIDENCE OF DIET	283	WHEN THE CAUSE FOR THE DISEASE IS LOOKED AT IT SEEMS THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS MOST LIKELY THE CHICKENS WERE GIVEN A DIET OF CORN MEAL WHICH WERE CONTAMINATED WITH DISEASE X ONE OUT OF THE NINE CHICKENS BECAME SICK THERE COULD BE SOMETHING CRUCIAL MISSING IN THEIR DIET OR THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY A CONTAMINATION IN THE MEALS IN THE CASE WHERE MEN VOLUNTEERED THIS ALSO CAN HAVE SOME RELATIVITY IN PROVING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING IN THE DIET OF THE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A POOR DIET DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X	284	THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE IS BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE IN DOCTOR 1S EXPERIMENT THE PATIENTS COULD BE PEOPLE WHO ATE BOTH RICH DIET AND POOR DIET ALSO IN DOCTOR 2S EXPERIMENT ALTHOUGH ALL THE 9 CHICKENS WERE GIVEN THE SAME DIET ONLY ONE HAD THE DISEASE	285	I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE X IS DIETARY I CAME TO THEN CONCLUSION BASED ON DOCTORS 3 STUDY THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ALL OF ELEVEN MALE THAT LIVED TOGETHER HAD A POOR MEAL AND LIVED IN A VERY CLEAN HOUSE AND THEY WERE KEPT CLEAN ALSO BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BECAME DISEASED WHILE THE MEN WHO DIDNT LIVED IN A CLEAN PLACE AND WERENT KEPT THAT CLEAN BUT HAD A GOOD DIET NONE OF THEM BECAME DISEASED THE STUDY SHOWS THAT IF ONE OF THE 20 MEN WAS DISEASED THEN THE OTHERS SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE DISEASE THROUGH A BACTERIAL VIRUS NUT NONE OF THEM DID THE 11 MEN WHO HAD POOR DIET BECAME DISEASED EVEN THOUGH THE LIVING CONDITIONS WERE SANITIZED SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIETARY	286	I THINK BACTERIUM VIRUS IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE IN 2 OUT OF THREE CASES THE DISEASE WAS CONTRACTED BY PEOPLE WHO HAD NORMAL DIETS THERE WERE NO OTHER REFERENCES TO DIET IN STUDY THREE ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED THROUGH FOOD THEY COULD HAVE BEEN CONTAGIOUS AND PASSED THE DISEASE TO OTHERS THIS IS WHAT SEEMED TO HAPPEN IN THE OTHER STUDIES AS WELL	287	WITH SANITARY CONDITIONS THOSE WHO ATE POORLY 5 OUT OF 11 GOT THE DISEASE WITH UNSANITARY CONDITIONS AND A RICH DIET 0 OUT OF 20 DEVELOPED THE DISEASE STUDY 3 IS VERY CONCLUSIVE	288	I THINK THAT A BACTERIUM VIRUS WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE IN ALL CASES THE PEOPLE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO EACH OTHER SO THE BACTERIUM VIRUS COULD BE SPREAD EASILY THROUGH CONTACT OR EVEN CONTAMINATED FOOD IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE MEN WHO WERE POORLY FED COULDVE HAD FOOD THAT WASNT VERY FRESH THUS HAVING SOME SORT OF CONTAMINATION OR BACTERIA	289	I BELIEVE THIS DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A VIRUS OR BACTERIA BECAUSE THE CHICKENS IN EXPERIMENT 2 AND THE HUMANS IN EXPERIMENT 1 ALL SHOWED SIGNS OF A VIRUS OR BACTERIA THEY LIVED IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER INFECTED PEOPLE ATE SIMILAR FOOD AND STILL THERE IS NOT A CLEAR REASON WHY THIS MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BECOME INFECTED I THINK THAT A DIETARY ILLNESS IS POSSIBLY THE CAUSE BUT ITS HARD TO PROVE BASED ON JUST ONE STUDY	290	I BELIEVE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DISEASE X BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENT IN TWO OF THE THREE CASES STUDIED IN THE SECOND STUDY ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT SICK THAT CHICKEN MAY HAVE EATEN MORE OF THE CONTAMINATED FOOD THAN THE REST OF THEM IN THE THIRD STUDY THOSE WHO WERE LIVING IN CLEAN HOUSE BUT EATING POOR DIETS SHOWED TO BE MORE APPLICABLE TO HAVE THE DISEASE THAN THOSE WHO LIVED IN DIRTY HOUSE AND ATE HEALTHY DIETS	291	WELL SIMPLY BECAUSE IF YOU DONT EAT RIGHT MEANING HAVE A BALANCED PLAN WITH ENOUGH CARBOHYDRATES PROTEIN AND ETC IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT PEOPLE WILL START TO SEE CHANGES IN THEIR BODY THAT THEY WONT NORMALLY SEE CHANGES THAT CAN SERIOUSLY EFFECT YOU	292	I BELIEVE BACTERIUM IS TO BLAME BECAUSE IN STUDY ONE MORE NEIGHBORS AND PEOPLE WHO ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER DISEASED PEOPLE GOT THE DISEASE SO EITHER NEIGHBORS WHO OFTEN GET THEIR FOOD FROM THE SAME PLACES WERE INFECTED OR PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CONTACT AND POSSIBLY ATE TOGETHER GOT THE DISEASE THE FEW RANDOM CASES COULD JUST ATE CONTAMINATED FOOD AND HAPPEN TO HAVE RELATIVES THAT HAD DISEASE X OR THEY WERE SENT FOOD BY RELATIVES WITH DISEASE X	293	ACCORDING TO THE IMMENSE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO SHOWED DISEASE X AND THOSE WHO DID NOT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY OF THE 20 SUBJECTS USED IN THIS STUDY WHO WERE GIVEN A RICH DIET NONE OF THE SUBJECTS SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF DISEASE X OF THE 11 SUBJECTS GIVEN A POOR DIET HOWEVER 6 OF THEM SHOWED SIGNS OF DISEASE X DUE TO THE IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN RESULTS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS I AM SWAYED TOWARD THE NOTION THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE AS BEING DUE TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	294	I CHOSE BACTERIUM VIRUS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X BECAUSE IT HAD THE MOST EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT IN TWO OF THE THREE STUDIES PRESENTED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BACTERIA IS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X CONVERSELY EACH OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSE GENETIC AND DIETARY DEFICIENCY ONLY APPEARED IN ONE STUDY EACH HOWEVER I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO DEFINITIVELY STATE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE	295	IT IS BECAUSE THE FIRST STUDY WE CAN SEE THAT MAY BE THESE PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEXT TOGETHER MAY EAT THE SAME KINDS OF FOOD WHICH CARRY THE BACTERIA THUS THEY GOT DISEASE X IN SECOND STUDY IT SHOWS US THAT BACTERIA IN FOOD AFFECTS CHICKEN THUS THOSE CHICKEN HAVE DISEASE X IN THIRD STUDY THESE GAY ATE POOR DIET SO THEY CANT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVER COME WHEN THE DISEASE COME IN THEIR BODIES HOWEVER THOSE GAY ATE HEALTH FOOD SO THEY ARE STRONG TO OVER THE DISEASE	296	I BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE BECAUSE IN CASE ONE IT WAS COMMON IN PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WERE EATING THE SAME FOOD OR THEY LIVED NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER WHICH COULD POSSIBLY MEAN THAT THEY ATE THE SAME FARMED FOODS OR DRANK THE SAME WATER IN CASE TWO THE CHICKEN THAT GOT SICK WAS FEED CONTAMINATED FOOD THE BACTERIA IN THE FOOD CAUSED THE CHICKEN TO COME DOWN WITH DISEASE X IN CASE THREE THE MEN THAT WERE INFECTED WITH DISEASE X WERE LIVING IN A CLEAN SANITIZED HOUSE THEY CAUGHT DISEASE X FROM EATING CONTAMINATED FOOD POOR DIET	297	FIRST OF ALL THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS NOT EXCLUDED FROM ALL THREE STUDIES IN STUDY NUMBER ONE IT WASNT INDICATED IF THERE WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY PROBLEM OR NOT SO THAT CANT PROVE ANYTHING BUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO DID NOT LIVE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE X WERE SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X SO THAT CAN EXCLUDE THE BACTERIUM VIRUS CAUSES BUT THERE STILL IS A POSSIBILITY OF DISEASE X BEING CAUSED BY GENETIC CAUSES IN THE SECOND STUDY THERE IS POSSIBILITIES OF THE DISEASE BEING CAUSED BY BACTERIAL VIRUS ISSUES THERE ALSO CAN BE A DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSE BUT AS FAR AS GENETICS GO IT WASNT MENTIONED THAT THE CHICKENS WERE RELATED OR NOT SO NO COMMENT ON THAT IN THE THIRD STUDY I AM COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT IT IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY PROBLEM IT CERTAINLY CAN NOT BE BACTERIAL VIRUS CAUSE AND CANT BE GENETIC BECAUSE THE MEN WERE NOT RELATED SO THAT LEAVES US JUST TO DIETARY DEFICIENCY	298	DISEASE X COULD BE DUE TO BOTH A BACTERIUM VIRUS AND A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE FIRST TWO EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THAT A BACTERIUM VIRUS MAY HAVE BEEN PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON VIA A GERM OR COULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN CONTAMINATED FOOD THE THIRD EXPERIMENTS RESULTS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE SUBTLE HOWEVER THERE IS NOT ANY INDICATION IN THE THIRD EXPERIMENT THAT A BACTERIUM VIRUS IS INVOLVED SINCE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN A DIRTY ENVIRONMENT WERE HEALTHY AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT WHEREAS SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE CLEAN ENVIRONMENT WITH A POOR DIET GOT ILL THE THIRD EXPERIMENTS RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POOR DIET MAY BE A FACTOR IN CONTRACTING DISEASE X	299	THE EVIDENCE AND DATA THAT THE THIRD DOCTOR COLLECTED HELPED MAKE THE ISSUES MUCH MORE CLEAR THE DOCTOR HAD THREE CONTROLS THE DIRTY HOUSE THE GOOD DIET AND ABILITY TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH OTHERS VS THE CLEAN HOUSE THE POOR DIET AND SECLUSION FROM OTHERS DUE TO THESE VARIABLES YOU COULD HAVE TWO CONCLUSIONS BUT I THINK IT APPEARS THAT A DIET SEEMS TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE A DIET IS THE BASIS OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THAT WOULD HELP ANSWER WHY THE MEN IN THE FILTHY HOUSE WERE ABLE TO BE RESISTANT TO ANY BACTERIA ON THE OTHER HAND THE MEN IN THE CLEAN HOUSE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS WERE WEAKENED BY THE DIET SO THEY WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY BACTERIA OR VIRUSES	2100	BECAUSE THE STUDIES THAT WERE DONE SHOW THAT MOST OF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH DISEASE X WHERE SOMEHOW EXPOSED TO THE BACTERIA EITHER THROUGH THE FOOD THAT THEY EAT OR INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD THE BACTERIA	2101	I THINK THE CAUSE I CHOSE IN QUESTION 4 IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE IN THE FIRST TWO DOCTOR STUDIES I SAW THAT BACTERIUM VIRUS IS WHAT MADE THE PEOPLE DEVELOP DISEASE X CONTAMINATED FOOD AND CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS THE DISEASE LET IT BE IN THE SAME HOUSE OR EVEN A NEIGHBOR COULD RESULT IN YOU OR ANOTHER PERSON GETTING DISEASE X IN THE DOCTORS CASE THREE I SEE THAT A POOR DIET TRIGGERED THE PERSON TO GET DISEASE X BUT I BELIEVE THAT BACTERIA VIRUS STILL IS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF A PERSON GETTING DISEASE X	2102	THERE ARE TWO STUDIES THAT SEEM TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY COMPARED TO THE ONE STUDY SHOWING DIETARY DEFICIENCY	2103	A PERSON COULD THINK THAT THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY THAT OF A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IF THE THOUGHT THAT DOCTOR 3S STUDIES WERE CONCLUSIVE AND THEY AGREED WITH THEM THEN I AM SURE THAT THEY COULD THINK THAT DOCTOR ONES STUDIED SHOWED THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN SIMILAR AREAS HAD SIMILAR DIETS AND THAT DOCTOR 2S STUDY SHOWED THAT HE HAD FED THE CHICKENS AN IMPROPER DIET THEREFORE MAKING THEM SICK I FIND THIS A HARDER CONCLUSION TO DRAW WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BUT SOMEONE ELSE MAY THINK IT IS THE OBVIOUS AND MOST CONCLUSIVE ANSWER IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE PERSON FIND TO BE MOST LOGICAL	2104	I THINK THAT OVERALL DISEASE X WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIA IN THE FIRST CASE ALL OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE WERE IN RELATIVELY CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER LIVING EITHER TOGETHER OR NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER AND NO DIET PROBLEMS WERE RECODED THIS DOES NOT EITHER SUPPORT OR RULE OUT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IT DOES RULES OUT GENETICS BECAUSE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER NOT WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY BE RELATED BACTERIA IS THE BEST ANSWER IN THAT CASE STUDY BECAUSE THE COMMONALITY AMONG THE PERCENTAGES IS THAT PEOPLE WERE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN THE SECOND CASE ONLY ONE CHICKEN OUT OF 9 WAS INFECTED WITH DISEASE X EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL WERE INJECTED WITH BLOOD AND BACTERIA FROM PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X I AUTOMATICALLY RULED OUT GENETICS AS I DID IN THE FIRST CASE STUDY ALSO I THINK IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE WAS DIETARY DEFICIENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE CHICKENS WERE FED THE SAME FOOD EVERY DAY I DO NOT KNOW IF THE CHICKENS WERE RELATED BUT IF THEY WERE AND THE DISEASE WAS GENETIC THEN MORE CHICKENS WOULD HAVE BEEN INFECTED PROCESS OF ELIMINATION CONCLUDES THAT BACTERIA IS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE DISEASE IN CASE STUDY 3 I WAS NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT THE DISEASE WAS EITHER BACTERIAL OR DIETARY DEFICIENT BUT I DO NOT THINK IT IS GENETIC I AM LEANING MORE TOWARD DIETARY DEFICIENCY FOR THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE NONE OF THE MEN WHO ATE HEALTHY FOOD BECAME INFECTED YET ALSO A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THE MEN WHO ATE THE POOR DIET WERE INFECTED THEN I THOUGHT ALL OF THOSE MEN COULD BE RELATED THE CASE STUDY DOES NOT STATE WHETHER OR NOT THESE MEN KNOW EACH OTHER OVERALL I AM LEANING TOWARD BACTERIA AS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BUT I AM NOT 100 CONVINCED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DATA IN STUDY 1 ABOUT DIET AND THE SUPPORTING DATA FROM STUDY 3 OF DIET BEING THE CAUSE	2105	I THINK THE DISEASE IS A BACTERIA OR VIRUS THAT IS PASSED ON FROM PERSON TO PERSON ONLY PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND EACH OTHER SEEMED TO GET THIS DISEASE I THINK THAT BAD NUTRITION JUST MAKES THE DISEASE WORST AND MORE DETECTABLE JUST LIKE IF YOU ARE SICK WITH THE COLD AND YOU DO NOT TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES BY EATING RIGHT THEN YOU WILL NOT GET BETTER	2106	DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE IT IS GIVEN MORE INFORMATION AND IT IS 2 OUT OF 3 THE DOCTOR 2 AND 3 GAVE MORE REALISTIC INFORMATION AND ACCURATELY	2107	I THINK THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS THROUGH BACTERIUM OR VIRUS I THINK THIS BECAUSE IN THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY IN 80 OF 115 PEOPLE WHO WERE DIAGNOSED FOUND SOMEONE ELSE WITH DISEASE X EITHER LIVING WITH THEM OR LIVING NEXT DOOR THAT IS MORE THAN HALF WHICH CAN COUNT TOWARDS THE LEVEL OF TRANSMISSION SECONDLY THE SECOND DOCTORS STUDY SHOWED THAT HE HAD IMPLANTED BACTERIA INTO THE CORNMEAL TO MAKE IT CONTAMINATED RATHER THAN THE CORNMEAL BEING CONTAMINATED SPONTANEOUSLY FROM BACTERIA GROWING WITHIN IT ALREADY	2108	I THINK THAT BACTERIA IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE I THINK THAT THE BACTERIA CAN BE SPREAD IN MANY WAYS LIKE THROUGH HUMAN CONTACT OR AN UNCLEAN ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT THE BACTERIA CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN FOOD AND THAT IS WHY IN THE LAST STUDY THEY MADE THE DISEASE SEEM RELATED TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	2109	IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THE DISEASE WAS PASSED BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO LIVED TOGETHER OR WERE NEIGHBORS SUGGESTING THAT A BUG WAS PROBABLY THE CAUSE IN EXPERIMENT 2 DIFFERENT STRAINS OF A BACTERIA WERE TESTED AND THIS WAS THE ONLY DIFFERING FACTOR BETWEEN ALL SUBJECTS TO CAUSE THE DISEASE MEN WHO ATE BAD DIETS IN THE THIRD EXPERIMENT CONTRACTED THE DISEASE AND BAD FOOD USUALLY CONTAINS BACTERIA OF SOME SORT	2110	THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS SINCE ALL THREE STUDIES TURNED UP WITH THAT POSSIBILITY THE CONSISTENCY OF THIS INFORMATION IS WHAT DETERMINED MY CHOICE	2111	I CHOSE DIETARY DEFICIENCY TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE OF THE ENDING RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS DONE BY DOCTORS TWO AND THREE BECAUSE IN BOTH STUDIES THE FOOD PROVIDED TO THE CHICKENS AND MEN WERE NOT HEALTHY OR NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH AND WAS PROBABLY THE CAUSE WHY THEY ENDED UP SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT	2112	BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO STUDIES SHOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE X AMONG PEOPLE WHO EITHER LIVE IN THE SAME COMMUNITY OR WERE IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X SYMPTOMS THEY MIGHT EITHER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED VIA DIRECT CONTACT OR INDIRECT CONTACT AS WATER SUPPLY FOOD SOURCE ETC THE SAME WITH THE 11 MEN WHO DEVELOPED THE SYMPTOMS IN EXPERIMENT 3 PROBABLY THE FOOD THEY ATE WAS CONTAMINATED ALSO	2113	I THINK THAT DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIA I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION AFTER READING STUDY 1 AND STUDY 2 AFTER READING STUDY 3 I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSED MY A BACTERIA BUT I THINK THAT EATING A HEALTHY DIET MAKES DISEASE X NOT INFECT A PERSON I THOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IN STUDY 3 OUT OF THE 20 MEN THAT LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE BUT ATE A RICH DIET NONE OF THEM SHOWED DISEASE X IF IT WAS SPREAD BY A BACTERIA THEN AT LEAST A FEW OF THE MEN WOULD HAVE HAD IT ALSO IN STUDY 2 WITH THE CHICKENS ONLY THE CHICKEN WHO WAS GIVEN BACTERIA 5 DEVELOPED DISEASE X I THINK THAT THIS DISEASE COMES IN MANY FORMS AND THAT EATING A GOOD DIET CAN PREVENT A PERSON FROM GETTING IT	2114	I BELIEVE IT A VIRUS BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER WAS GETTING DISEASE X IN THE FIRST STUDY YOU SEE PEOPLE LIVING WITH OR LIVING CLOSE TO A PERSON WITH THE DISEASE PEOPLE SOCIALIZE WITH EACH OTHER AND SO THERE IS MORE CHANCES OF GETTING THE DISEASE THAT WAY IN THE 2ND STUDY THE DOCTOR ISOLATE THE INFECTIOUS CHICKEN AND GAVE IT A GOOD DIET AND IT BECOME BETTER	2115	ANALYZING ALL THE INFORMATION FROM THE THREE DOCTORS IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THE DISEASE IS PASSES BY EITHER BACTERIA OR A VIRUS ALTHOUGH DIET SEEMS POSSIBLE I THINK THE DIET OF THESE PATIENTS MAINLY AFFECTED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEIR ABILITY TO COMBAT THE DISEASE RATHER THAN BEING THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE LIVING IN SQUALOR AND HAVING CONTACT WITH MANY PEOPLE INCREASE THE CHANCES OF COMING INTO CONTACT WITH POSSIBLE BACTERIA OR VIRAL DISEASES	2116	I THINK THE CAUSE I CHECKED IN 4 DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH NUTRITION MAY BE EASILY GET THE DISEASE IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH FOOD AND NUTRITION THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL BE STRONGER AND NOT EASY TO GET THE DISEASE	2117	IF TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS GAVE THE SAME CONCLUSIONS THEN I THINK THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS SUPPORTED THE MOST THE AS TWO DOCTORS DID THEIR EXPERIMENTS DIET RELATED	2118	BECAUSE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO CONTRACT A DISEASE THROUGH A COUGH OR A SNEEZE OR SOME CONTAMINATED FOOD IT TAKES A LOT TO OBTAIN A DISEASE BY EATING THE WRONG DIET YOU ALMOST HAVE TO PLAN IT OUT LIKE THEY DID IN THIS EXPERIMENT BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW BADLY YOU EAT SOMETIMES YOU STILL MOSTLY GET SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF YOUR DIET WHICH CAN HELP PREVENT DISEASE SO THEREFORE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO CONTRACT DISEASE THROUGH A BACTERIA OR A VIRUS	2119	IN ALL THE CASES IT COULD NOT BE EXPLICITLY PROVED THAT THE DISEASE IS GENETIC THERE WERE NO GENETIC TESTING DONE FURTHERMORE THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY PROBLEM COULD ONLY BE ARGUED IN THE THIRD EXPERIMENT AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO REFUTE IT ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE FOOD THEY ATE HAD THE VIRUS AND THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE FED INSUFFICIENTLY FOR PROPER NUTRITION THERE IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT OF THE VIRUS	2120	I THINK THAT A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE BECAUSE WITH IMPORTANT FOODS ABSENT FROM ONES DIET IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR A DISEASE TO INVADE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SINCE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS ARE MISSING DISEASE X CAN THEN EASILY WANDER ITS WAY IN AND CAUSE SEVER SICKNESS WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION OR ANTIBODIES	2121	TWO OF THE THREE DOCTORS SUGGEST THAT DISEASE X AS CAUSED BY BACTERIA IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE TWO DOCTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE BACTERIA INFECTIONS TO DISEASE X AND ARE CORRECT THAN JUST ONE DOCTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES DIETARY FACTORS TO DISEASE X HOWEVER ONE DOCTOR THAT SAID IT WAS BACTERIA DID HIS EXPERIMENTS ON CHICKENS AND NOT HUMANS AND COULD BE WRONG NEVERTHELESS TWO PEOPLE CONTRIBUTING THE SAME CAUSE IS MORE CONVINCING THAN ONE DOCTORS FINDINGS	2122	IN DOCTOR 2S EXPERIMENT ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT SICK THE CHICKENS WERE FED THE SAME DIET THIS WOULD TEND TO INDICATE THAT THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS BUT AGGRAVATED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	2123	I DONT BELIEVE THE CAUSE IS GENETIC DOCTOR 1S STUDY SHOWED THAT A MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X WERE RELATIVES OF PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X OR LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD DOCTOR 3S STUDY IS VERY PERSUASIVE THAT THE CAUSE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY DOCTOR 2S STUDY DOESNT CARRY MUCH WEIGHT IT DID NOT SHOW A STRONG LINK BETWEEN DISEASE X AND A BACTERIAL CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IF DIETARY DEFICIENCY WAS A MAJOR CAUSE THEN MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED DISEASE X IN THE LARGE DOCTOR 1S STUDY BUT I FELT THAT DOCTOR 3S STUDY WAS VERY WELL CONTROLLED AND THAT DOCTOR 1S STUDY WAS MORE AMBIGUOUS	2124	IN THESE EXAMPLES IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY DIET OR BACTERIA VIRUS IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT CAUSED BY GENETICS STUDY 1 SAYS NOTHING ABOUT DIET STUDY TWO SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT DIET BUT ITS IMPACT IS UNCLEAR STUDY 3 SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT POOR DIET DOES NOT AFFECT THE DISEASE AND THIS STUDY SEEMS TO BE MORE HIGHLY CONTROLLED WITH FEWER VARIABLES FOR THIS REASON I CHOSE BACTERIA VIRUS RATHER THAN POOR DIET AS BEING THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X	2125	I THINK THAT BACTERIUM VIRUS IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE THIS IS BECAUSE TWO OUT OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTS ONE AND TWO SEEMED LIKE THE DISEASE WAS BACTERIUM OR VIRAL THE THIRD STUDY WAS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN GET THIS DISEASE FROM A NUMBER OF REASONS AND BACTERIA SEEMED TO BE THE MOST LOGICAL	2126	I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE FROM THE THIRD STUDY WAS THE MOST CONVINCING BECAUSE NONE OF THE 20 MEN WHO ATE A RICH DIET GOT THE DISEASE EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE AND HAD CONTACT FROM OTHER PEOPLE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE OTHER STUDIES PRESENT STRONG EVIDENCE THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT WERE MORE COMPELLING	2127	THE ONE WHICH SEEMED TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY EVIDENCE SHOWN IN TWO MADE ME THINK THAT THIS WAS TRUE BUT FROM 3 I WAS POSITIVE THAT IT WAS THAT REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE THIRD ONE THOSE WHO DEVELOPED THE DISEASE WERE AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE SINCE THEY WERE NOT WITH OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A VIRUS THIS IS SPREAD WITH CONTACT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO CONTACT ALSO THERE WAS NO FAMILY RELATED ISSUES IN 3 SO WE KNOW THAT IT HAD TO BE DIETARY	2128	STUDIES 1 AND 2 BOTH CORRELATE WITH A BACTERIAL OR VIRAL DISEASE EVEN THOUGH STUDY 3 POINTS TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE MEN IN THAT STUDY COULDVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME KIND OF BACTERIA	2129	THE 2ND AND THIRD STUDY BOTH SAID IT WAS DIET AND OR BACTERIUM AND THE FIRST STUDY SAID THAT MOST THE INFECTED PEOPLE LIVED CLOSE TOGETHER THAT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS BACTERIUM THAT LIVED ON THE FOOD IN THE HOUSE NEAR EACH OTHER	2130	I THINK THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE IS BACTERIAL BASED ON THE DATA SUBMITTED IN STUDY 1 AND 2 STUDY 1 SHOWS A CLOSE GROUP PEOPLE WHO ALL CONTRACTED THE DISEASE WHILE STUDY 2 SHOWS A LINK IN THE CONTAMINATED FOOD I LINK BOTH STUDIES TOGETHER BECAUSE IN CLOSE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THERE ARE USUALLY STAPLE EVERYDAY FOODS WHICH EVERYONE SHARES OR EATS THEREFORE THE DISEASE COULD HAVE BEEN PASSED IF THAT FOOD SUPPLY WAS CONTAMINATED AS IN DISEASE 2 AND IF EVERYONE IN THAT COMMUNITY EATS THAT SAME FOOD AS PART OF THEIR DIET AS IN EXAMPLE 1	2131	IN THE DR 3 WE SEE THAT ALL WERE OKAY UNTIL THE POOR DIET CAME ALONG MORE THAN 50 DEVELOPED DISEASE X THE DATA HERE SHOWED MORE PROOF HERE IN MY OPINION THAT DID THAT IN DR 1 OR 2 RESULTS	2132	BECAUSE MOST OF THE CASES REPORTED WITH THE DISEASE HAS BEING PEOPLE THAT HAD CONTACT WITH A DISEASED INDIVIDUAL AND THERE ARE MORE EVIDENCES USING A LARGE EXAMPLE AS IT SHOWS ON STUDIES 1 2	2133	I THINK STUDY NUMBER ONE WHILE IT DOES SHOW SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER I BELIEVE THIS IS A COINCIDENCE CORRELATIONS LIKE THIS CAN BE FOUND EVERYWHERE AND DONT NECESSARILY MEAN ANYTHING IE MY NEIGHBOR TO THE LEFT AND THE NEIGHBOR TO MY RIGHT AS WELL AS MYSELF ALL HAVE LIGHT BROWN HAIR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ACROSS FROM US ALL HAVE DARK HAIR DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING NOT AT ALL SO I AM KIND OF IGNORING THIS STUDY AND THE RESULTS BASED ON THE OTHER TWO STUDIES I AM GUESSING THAT THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH A BACTERIA THAT WILL ONLY CAUSE PROBLEMS IF THE RIGHT FOOD ISNT EATEN MAYBE PROTEIN IN ONES DIET HELPS WARD OFF THIS BACTERIA VIRUS THEN THERE IS THE NAGGING THOUGHT IN MY HEAD THAT THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING CAUSED BY GENETICS THAT IS TRIGGERED BY SOMETHING IN OR LACKING FROM ONES DIET OR POSSIBLY A BACTERIA VIRUS IF IT WERE TO BE BACTERIA ALONE THEN I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IT OCCURRING IN PLACES THAT ARE UNSANITARY OR AMONG PEOPLE THAT ALL LIVED TOGETHER THIS IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO HIT RANDOM GROUPS OF PEOPLE LIKE THE 6 OUT OF THE 11 THAT LIVED IN A HOUSE IN STUDY 3 I WOULDNT SAY THAT THIS IS 100 GENETICS THAT LEAVES ME WITH ONE OPTION THE DIETARY CONDITIONS	2134	I BELIEVE IT WAS RESULT OF BACTERIA VIRUS BECAUSE IT WAS REMEDIED IN DR 1 AND DR 2S EXPERIMENTS OVER TIME AND THE REMOVAL OF THE DISEASE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTS	2135	THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE COULD BE DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IN THE EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY DOCTOR 3 ALL THE PEOPLE WERE HEALTHY BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT AND 6 PEOPLE OF THE 11 GOT THE DISEASE X THE 20 PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED RICH DIET DID NOT GET THE DISEASE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MADE TO LIVE UNDER POOR LIVING CONDITIONS AND WERE ALLOWED OUTSIDE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE	2136	IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY HE DID HAVE PEOPLE SEPARATED IN DIFFERENT ROOMS AND WITH DIFFERENT SANITATION I ASSUME THIS DOCTOR HAD A HYPOTHESIS OF BEING MALNUTRITION IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE HOWEVER HE DIDNT REALIZED THAT THOSE CLEAN MAN WHO WERE ON A POOR DIETARY GUIDE LINE ALSO COULD GET THE BACTERIA FROM THE FOOD THEY ARE TAKING THE SANITATION OF THOSE FOOD WOUNDNT BE AS GOOD AS THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN A DIRTY HOUSEHOLD ON EXPERIMENT 2 THE DOCTOR HAVE GROW THOSE BACTERIA ON CORNMEAL TO FEED TO THE CHICKEN AND ONLY BACTERIA 5 CAUSED THE DISEASE THIS SHOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE DISEASE IN EXPERIMENT ONE OF 115 DISEASED PEOPLE 87 PEOPLE HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER 64 OF THESE WERE LIVING NEXT DOOR TO PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X THAT MEANS THIS BACTERIA OR VIRUS MAY TRANSMITTED THROUGH WATER SYSTEM AND SO FORCE LOTS OF THEM ARE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR RELATIVES WITH DISEASE PEOPLE IT MAY TRANSMITTED THROUGH FOOD OR EVEN AIR THEREFORE ITS CAUSE BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS	2137	I THINK THE BACTERIA CAUSED THE DISEASE BECAUSE BY DOCTOR 1S STUDY PEOPLE LIVE IN SAME AREA COULD HAVE SAME BACTERIA THAT CAUSED THE DISEASE AND BY DOCTOR 2S STUDY CHICKENS GOT DISEASE FROM THE BACTERIA THAT THE RESEACHERS PUT INTO THE FOOD	2138	THE REASON FOR ME TO CHOOSE DIETARY DEFICIENCY FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THE DISEASE ARE 1 BASE ON THE DATA THAT DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE 11 MEN WHO DID NOT HAVE DISEASE BUT WHEN THEY ATE THE POOR DIET THEY GOT DISEASE X AFTER THEY ATE POOR DIET EVEN THEY LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE SO WE KNOW THAT THE DISEASE PROBABLY CAUSE BY THE DIETARY 2 THE 20 MEN WHO DID NOT HAVE DISEASE DID NOT GET X DISEASE 5 MONTHS LATER EVEN THEY LIVED WITH OTHER PEOPLE THEREFORE WE CAN ELIMINATE THE BACTERIUM VIRUS 3 ON DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE SICK CHICKEN GOT RID OF THE DISEASE AFTER IT CHANGE THE DIET SO WE KNOW IT SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DIET	2139	IN STUDY 3 THE DISEASE WAS EITHER CAUSED BY A DEFICIENCY IN DIET CONTACT OR UNCLEAN LIVING CONDITIONS OR A COMBINATION OF THE THREE THIS IS TRUE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN STUDY 2 THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY A BACTERIA FOUND IN BLOOD OR FOOD IN STUDY 1 NEIGHBORS WERE AFFECTED MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN PEOPLE IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD SO DIRECT CONTACT WAS NOT NECESSARILY THE CAUSE THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE POINTING TO BACTERIA VIRUS SOME KIND OF CONTAMINATION UNCLEAN LIVING CONDITIONS FOR STUDY 3 AND CONTAMINATED FOOD AND OR WATER FOR STUDY 2 AND 1	2140	STUDY 3 HAS A STRONGER ARGUMENT THAN THE OTHERS I THINK THE EXPERIMENT WAS OF BETTER QUALITY AND THE RESULTS MORE MEANINGFUL	2141	STUDY 1 IT IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT FROM THIS STUDY WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IT IS A POOR STUDY STUDY 2 BACTERIA 5 PROBABLY INTERACTED WITH THE CHICKENS NORMAL HEALTH AND MADE IT SICK ONCE THE CHICKEN WAS OUT OF THE DIET IT GOT BETTER STUDY 3 HERE THE PEOPLE WITH GOOD DIET HAD NO SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE SO STUDY 2 AND 3 SHOWS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIET AND STUDY 1 IS NOT A GOOD STUDY I THINK IT IS DIET	2142	IT COULD BE A BACTERIUM VIRUS OR A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE ONE AND TWO SUPPORT THE FORMER WITH NO EVIDENCE THAT IT COULD BE DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN CASE THREE IT IS PLAIN AND SIMPLE THAT IT IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY IF DIET WAS THE MAIN VARIABLE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF GENETICS PLAY ANY ROLE IN ANY CASE ALTHOUGH CASE ONE INDICATES THAT FAMILY MEMBERS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE IF NOT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE	2143	IN ALL THREE CASES THE CAUSE COULD BE BACTERIUM OR VIRUS THIS IS BECAUSE IN ALL CASES THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WERE LIVING CLOSELY TOGETHER OR RECEIVING CONTAMINATED FOOD I RULED OUT DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IN ONLY ONE CASE WAS THERE EVIDENCE THAT A POOR DIET HAD ANY AFFECT ON THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE A POOR DIET MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR MAKING THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS WEAKER AND THEREFORE THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE POOR DIET WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THE CHICKEN THAT BECAME ILL MAY HAVE BEEN JUST A WEAKER INDIVIDUAL OR HAD SOME OTHER PREDISPOSING PROBLEM THEY SHOULD HAVE RUN THE CHICKEN EXPERIMENT FOR LONGER AND SAW IF THE INFECTED CHICKEN WAS LEFT IN THE AREA IF MORE BECAME SICK OR COMPARED TO IF IT WAS TAKEN AWAY ETC	2144	A VIRUS OR BACTERIA COULD BE STAYING DORMANT INSIDE OF A PERSON AND NOT HAVE A NOTICEABLE AFFECT UNTIL THE PERSON IS NOT NOURISHED PROPERLY AND THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE WEAKENED HOWEVER THE SAME CAN ALSO BE SAID OF A GENETIC DISEASE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT GENE TRANSCRIPTION AS FOR THE MEN SECLUDED IN THE HOUSE PERHAPS IT TAKES MORE THAN THREE MONTHS TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THE PATHOGEN IF THAT IS THE CASE IN THIS SITUATION THE DISEASE WAS REPORTED AFTER 8	2145	I ELIMINATED THE POSSIBILITY OF GENETICS AS THE CAUSE FROM THE FIRST STUDY SINCE IT WAS MORE COMMON AMONG NEIGHBORS THAN HOUSEMATES WHICH ARE OFTEN FAMILY MEMBERS THE THIRD ACCOUNT WAS THE MOST CONVINCING AS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY HOWEVER THERE WERE TOO MANY VARIABLES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WHICH GAVE ME LITTLE FAITH IN THE STUDY THEREFORE I CHOSE BACTERIUM VIRUS	2146	I THINK THAT DISEASE X IS SPREAD BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS BECAUSE EACH STUDY SEEMS TO POINT TOWARD THAT CONCLUSION THE MAJORITY OF AFFECTED PEOPLE STUDIED IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH ANOTHER PERSON WITH THE DISEASE THIS SUGGESTS THAT IT COULD BE SPREADING FROM PERSON TO PERSON DOCTOR 2S STUDY SHOWED THAT FREQUENT INGESTION OF FOOD CONTAMINATED WITH A PARTICULAR BACTERIA WILL CAUSE SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO DISEASE X DOCTOR 3S STUDY SHOWED THAT THE VOLUNTEERS EATING THE POOR DIET WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTRACTING THE DISEASE BUT THIS COULD STILL BE CAUSED THROUGH CONTAMINATED FOOD BECAUSE ALL SUBJECTS WERE EATING THE SAME FOOD	2147	I THINK THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY A BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT ELIMINATED AS A CAUSE FROM ANY OF THE STUDIES AND IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY FOR STUDY 1 NO MENTION OF RELATION OF THE PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER WAS MENTIONED SO IT COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FOR STUDY 2 THE DIET WAS CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTALLY SO THAT IS MOSTLY LIKELY NOT A FACTOR BUT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF SAMPLE GROUP SIZES MAKES THAT STUDY FAULTY ALSO THEIR IS NO MENTION IF THE CHICKENS COME FROM DIFFERENT PARENTAL LINES SO GENETICS CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN THE THIRD STORY THERE WERE SIMPLY TO MANY FACTS MISSING TO RULE ANYTHING OUT PLUS THERE WERE TOO MANY VARIABLES TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN DIET AND GENETIC DIFFERENCES CAN MAKE PEOPLE MORE PRONE TO DISEASE	2148	THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO SUGGEST A VIRUS MY STRONGEST INDICATOR OF THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST POWER DUE TO ITS GREATER NUMBER OF SUBJECTS GENETICS COULD BE A FACTOR IN SUSCEPTIBILITY BUT NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN ABOUT WHO IN THE HOUSE WAS SICK AND HOW MANY WERENT OR EVEN THE SEX OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OR WERENT AFFECTED AND UNLESS THE NEIGHBORS ARE FAMILY THEY CANCEL GENETICS OUT ALONE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE THIRD STUDY WHO WERE ALL MALES AND PRESUMABLY NOT RELATED THE CHICKEN STUDY HAS NO STRENGTH AT ALL WHEN ONLY ONE TEST SUBJECT IS USED THERE ARE ISSUES OF VARIABILITY WHILE THE DIET MAY HAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES OF GETTING THE DISEASE DIET ALONE CAN PROBABLY BE RULED OUT BY REPEAT STUDIES	2149	IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONCLUDE THE REASONS FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF DISEASE X THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY DOCTOR 1 CAREFULLY COLLECTED INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED ABOUT 5 514 PEOPLE LIVING IN SIX VILLAGES IN CAROLINA COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA THIS STUDY IS A FIELD EXPERIMENT NON OF THE VARIABLES EITHER THE PEOPLE OR THE DISEASE IS MANIPULATED THIS IS PURELY AN OBSERVATION OF THE OCCURRENCE OF DISEASE X THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT A HIGH PERCENTAGE 80 OF THE 115 CASES OF DISEASE X EITHER LIVED WITH SOMEONE OR LIVED NEXT TO SOMEONE WITH DISEASE X OF THE REMAINING 23 PATIENTS WHO DID NOT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY 7 WERE RELATED TO SOMEONE WITH DISEASE X AND THEY HAD RECENT CONTACT WITH THEM WITHOUT CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL STUDIES I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS CONCLUDING THAT DISEASE X IS A VIRAL DISEASE BECAUSE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AFFLICTED WERE RELATED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH THE DISEASE HOWEVER THERE WERE MANY CASES OF PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THE CONCLUSION THAT DISEASE X IS A GENETIC DISEASE DOCTOR 2 CONDUCTED AN ACTIVE EXPERIMENT WHERE ALL ASPECTS OF THE EXPERIMENT WERE MANIPULATED AND THE RESULTS MEASURED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF DISEASE X DISEASE X WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE DIET OF THE 9 CHICKENS BLOOD FROM PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE WAS ADDED TO CORNMEAL AND THEN FED TO THE CHICKENS THE CHICKENS WERE TAKEN OFF THE DIET OF RICE AFTER 38 DAYS AND THEN FED CRACKED CORN CHICKEN 5 DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X 88 DAYS AFTER THE DISEASE X CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL DIET WAS INTRODUCED THE CHICKEN WAS PLACED IN A DARK ROOM AND THE CORNMEAL DIET STOPPED THE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED AFTER 14 DAYS THIS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT SINCE THE OTHER CHICKENS WERE NOT AFFECTED DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY THE TYPE OF BACTERIA INTRODUCED TO THE CORNMEAL AND FED TO THE CHICKEN DOCTOR 3 CONDUCTED A RECENT EXPERIMENT WHICH MANIPULATED THE DIETARY AND LIVING ENVIRONMENTS OF ITS VOLUNTEERS TWO HOUSEHOLDS WERE SET UP ONE PROVIDED WHOLESOME FOOD AND CLEAN LIVING CONDITIONS THE OTHER A POOR DIET WITH LESS HYGIENIC LIVING ENVIRONMENT 6 CASES OF DISEASE X OCCURRED WITHIN THE SECOND HOUSE FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED POOR DIET SEEMED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF DISEASE X I CHOSE DIETARY DEFICIENCY AS THE CAUSE FOR DISEASE X DR ONE STUDIED A GROUP IN A PARTICULAR AREA OF SOUTH CAROLINA SINCE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS ALSO HAD THE DISEASE IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT DISEASE X IS NOT A GENETIC DISEASE RATHER A DIETARY DEFICIENT DISEASE DUE TO POOR SOCIOECONOMICS DR TWO INTRODUCED THE BACTERIA INTO THE DIET OF CHICKEN 5 SO THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE MAY BE DIETARY DR THREE PROVIDES POOR DIET AND LESS CLEAN LIVING ENVIRONMENT I AM CONSIDERING STRONGLY THAT DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY A DEFICIENT DIET	3150	I THINK IT IS DIET DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IF IT WAS TO BE BACTERIUM OR VIRUS ALL THE VILLAGERS WOULD HAVE HAD THE DISEASE BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY LIVE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER SINCE ONLY 115 OF THE POPULACE HAD DISEASE X AND THEIR NEIGHBORS HAD IT TO THEN THESE PEOPLE MUST LIVE IN A POOR ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE LOW INCOME FAMILY HAVE POOR BROKEN DOWN LIFE NECESSITIES CANT AFFORD A RICH BALANCED DIET ALSO SINCE 23 THAT DO NOT LIVE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAS DISEASE X OR NEXT TO THEM THEY HAD CONTACT WITH THEM THE CONTACT COULD HAVE BEEN IN EVENT OF A SUMMER VACATION OR MAYBE WHILE EMPLOYED OR TRYING TO FIND A HOUSE LIVED WITH RELATIVES AND IN TURN ALSO CONSUMED THE POOR DIET ALSO IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY HE NOTED THAT HE LEFT ONE BOTTLE OF THE CORN MEAL WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED IT REMAINED SWEET AND STERILE FOR OVER THREE MONTHS SINCE ALL THE CHICKENS WERE FED THE SAME THING AND WERE ALL HEALTHY CHICKENS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT THE CHICKEN THAT ATE FROM THE UNTOUCHED BOTTLE LEFT STERILE AND SWEET FOR THREE MONTHS MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING MISSING FROM ITS DIET BECAUSE THE MEAL COULD HAVE BAD THE UNTOUCHED BOTTLE MUST BE BOTTLE 5 AS WE CAN SEE WHEN THE ILL CHICKEN WAS TAKEN TO A DARK ROOM AND ITS DIET WAS CHANGED THE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE PEOPLE HEALTHY THAT WERE FED RICH DIET BUT LIVED IN A DIRTY UNCLEAN HOUSE DID NOT HAVE THE DISEASE WHILE THE 6 OF THE 11 HEALTHY PEOPLE THAT WERE FED POOR DIET AND LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE HAD THE DISEASE AFTER THE FIFTH MONTH THE 5 THAT DID NOT HAVE THE DISEASE MIGHT SHOW SYMPTOMS OVER MORE TIME	3151	IN MY OPINION THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X IS BACTERIUM VIRUS THE FIRST STUDY INDICATED THAT OUT OF 5514 PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY 115 HAD THE DISEASE X THOSE THAT HAD THE DISEASE MAJORITY LIVED IN THE SAME AREA EITHER LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEXT DOOR OR HAD CONTACT WITH THE RELATIVES OF DISEASE X 7 OUT OF 23 ADMITTED OF HAVING CONTACT WITH THE DISEASE X THE OTHER 16 OUT OF 23 PEOPLE SHOWED THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE HOWEVER THE STUDY DOESNT CONCLUSIVELY MENTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD CONTACT WITH THE DISEASED X PERSON PERHAPS WHAT LINKS THE DISEASE IS THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS WHERE GOOD NUTRITIONAL FOOD IS UNAVAILABLE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA THUS UNRELATED PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THE SAME RESULTS IN ADDITION WHEN THE SECOND STUDY INVOLVED CHICKENS AS SUBJECTS AND CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL AS A INDEPENDENT VARIABLE THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SYMPTOMS PRESENTED BY THE CHICKENS AFTER THEY HAVE CONSUMED THE CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT AFTER THE CONSUMPTION OF CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL ESPECIALLY PROMINENT 5 TYPE OF BACTERIA THE CHICKENS DISPLAYED SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO DISEASE X AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL AND SUBSTITUTED OF NORMAL CORNMEAL THE CHICKENS EXPERIENCE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT PERHAPS THE CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL LACKED NUTRITIONAL VALUE THE THIRD STUDY ALSO INCLUDES FOOD CONSUMPTION WHERE OUT OF 31 MALES TWENTY OF THEM WERE STUDIED UNDER A POOR ENVIRONMENT AND GOOD NUTRITION AND NONE SHOWED THE DISEASE X WHERE AS OUT OF THE 31 MALES 11 WERE STUDIED UNDER A GOOD ENVIRONMENT AND POOR NUTRITION AND 6 SHOWED THE DISEASE X AND 5 DID NOT THEREFORE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD THE POOR DIET	3152	STUDY TWO AND THREE BOTH DETERMINED THAT DISEASE X COULD IS RELATED TO A POOR DIET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BECAUSE ONE IS NOT EATING A BALANCED DIET THAT PERSONS IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL NOT BE AS CAPABLE OF FIGHTING OFF DISEASE X STUDY ONE COULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT WITH THIS MODEL IF THE PEOPLE IN THE STUDY ARE OF LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS THE POOR CAN NOT AFFORD TO EAT A BALANCED DIET AND ALSO MAY NOT BE EDUCATED ENOUGH TO KNOW THEY SHOULD EAT A BALANCED DIET	3153	IN THE EXPERIMENTS WITH CHICKENS ONE OF THE CHICKENS GOT SICK AFTER BEING TREATED WITH AFFECTED CORN MEAL AND WAS IMPROVED AFTER IT WAS FEED WITH NON CONTAMINATED CORN HOWEVER THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CHICKEN HAD DISEASE X EVEN THOUGH IT SHOWS SOME SYMPTOMS AND IT IMPROVES AFTER BEING TREADED WITH HEALTHY CORN THIS SHOWS THAT BACTERIA IS NOT A FACTOR OF THE X DISEASE THE FIRST DOCTOR TRIED TO PROVE THAT IT WAS A GENETIC DISEASE AND THERE WAS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS A GENETIC DISEASE SINCE MANY OF THE SICK PEOPLE WERE COUSINS OR LIVED NEXT DOOR HOWEVER THERE WERE 16 PEOPLE THAT HAD TO HAVE SOME RELATIVES SICK WITH THIS DISEASE AND THEY DID NOT SO IT SHADOWS THE THEORY THAT THIS IS A GENETIC DISEASE ON THE OTHER HAND THE THIRD DOCTOR SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS CONNECTED TO A POOR DIET	3154	IN STUDY 1 THE DOCTOR DOESNT REALLY TEST THE FACT OF DIETARY DEFICIENCY BUT IT COULD BE IMPLIED IN THE STUDY THE 115 PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE ALL LIVED IN THE SAME AREA 92 OUT OF 115 OF THEM LIVED EITHER TOGETHER OR NEXT DOOR TO THE PERSON WITH DISEASE X IF THEY LIVED IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY COULDNT AFFORD THE PROPER FOOD THAT COULD BE A WHY THERE WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY AND WOULD MAKE SENSE IN THE SECOND STUDY THE DOCTOR ONLY FED ONE CHICKEN EACH OF THE BACTERIA IF HE HAD FED IT TO MANY CHICKENS AND THEY ALL GOT SICK IT WOULD BE ONE THING BUT ONLY FEEDING EACH TO ONE CHICKEN IT COULD BE MERELY COINCIDENTAL THAT THE CHICKEN GOT SICK STUDY 3 HAS THE MOST EVIDENCE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IF IT WAS BACTERIA THE MEN LIVING IN THE DIRTY HOUSE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO GET DISEASE X THEN THE MEN LIVING IN THE CLEAN HOUSE THE MEN WHO ATE THE BAD DIET WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO GOT SICK THIS SHOWS THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE	3155	I THINK THE CAUSE FOR DISEASE X IS DUE TO DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE REASON I COME UP WITH THIS CONCLUSION IS BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY DOCTOR 2 ALL THE CHICKENS HAD THE SAME DIET BUT ONLY ONE WAS AFFECTED SO IT COULD BE THAT CHICKEN LACKED OTHER DIETARY DEFICIENCY BEFORE THEY WERE PUT INTO THE STUDY HOWEVER OUT OF THE DOCTORS DOCTOR 3 WAS THE ONE WHO HAD THE MOST EFFECTIVE STUDY BECAUSE IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ATE A POOR DIET WERE AFFECTED WITH THE DISEASE EVEN ID THEY LIVED IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT 6 GOT THE DISEASE AND 5 DID NOT THIS COULD BE THAT EVEN BEFORE THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED THE 6 THAT GOT THE DISEASE WERE ALREADY PROPENSITY TO HAVE THE ILLNESS BECAUSE PROBABLY THEY DID NOT MAINTAIN A GOOD A DIET I COME TO THIS CONCLUSION BECAUSE THE 20 INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVED IN UNSANITARY CONDITIONS AND ATE A GOOD DIET WERE NOT AFFECTED THEREFORE DIETARY DEFICIENCY HAD TO DO WITH GETTING THE DISEASE	3156	IN THE FIRST STUDY THE MOST POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS DIETARY DEFICIENCY EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE DISEASED PEOPLE WERE RELATED OR LIVED NEXT DOOR TO ONE ANOTHER THERE WAS A LARGE AND YET SMALLER NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAD THE DISEASE WITHOUT CONTACT TO DISEASE X THEREFORE THE DISEASE COULD NOT BE GENETIC OR CAUSED BY BACTERIA VIRUS IN THE SECOND STUDY THE TYPE 5 BACTERIA COULD HAVE BEEN A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BUT SINCE THERE WERE MORE BACTERIA TYPES AND THE REST OF THE CHICKENS DID NOT GET INFECTED BACTERIA 5 IS ONLY MINOR FACTOR OF THE DISEASE IN STUDY 3 DIETARY DEFICIENCY WAS THE OBVIOUS CAUSE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH 20 OF THE MEN LIVED IN DIRTY SURROUNDINGS THEY DID NOT GET THE DISEASE BECAUSE THEY ATE RICH DIETS AS OPPOSED TO THE MEN ON POOR DIETS AND LIVING IN CLEAN SURROUNDINGS MY CONCLUSION WOULD BE THAT DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY DIETARY DEFICIENCIES BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IN ONE STUDY THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIA OVERALL IT PLAYS AS THE KEY TO THE DISEASE	3157	IN CASE 1 THE DOCTORS ONLY OBSERVED THE 115 PATIENTS WITH DISEASE X AND THEN GAVE THEM A SURVEY ABOUT THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS THE SURVEY ABOUT THE LIVING CONDITIONS DOESNT EXPLORE OTHER CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIET LIKE CASE 3 CASE 3 IS WHAT LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT DISEASE X WAS A DISEASE BASED ON LACK OF SOMETHING HAVING TO DO WITH ONES DIET THE DOCTOR OF CASE 3 DID A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT WHICH ALLOWED HIM TO CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH HE WAS CONDUCTING HIS EXPERIMENT BECAUSE IT WAS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT THERE WAS LESS CHANCE OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE OF THOSE WHO WASNT INFECTED WITH THE DISEASE AND WAS GIVEN A RICH DIET WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND HAD A DIRTY HOUSE I RULED OUT THE OPTION OF THE DISEASE BEING TRANSMITTED THROUGH BACTERIUM OR VIRUS OF THOSE WHO DID GET INFECTED HAD A CLEAN HOUSE AND HAD NO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THERE WERE MEN WHO WAS IN THE SAME HOUSE AS THE INFECTED PEOPLE WHO DIDNT GET INFECTED THAT LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE POOR DIET THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE 11 MEN IN THE CLEAN HOUSE CAUSED MORE THAN HALF 6 OF THEM TO BECOME INFECTED WITH DISEASE WITH CASES 1 2 THERE WAS MORE OF A CHANCE OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE THAN THERE WAS WITH CASE 3 CASE 3 WAS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT	3158	I BELIEVE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE X BECAUSE IN ALL CASES THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS PROVEN MOST LIKELY TO BE THE ONE IN THE SECOND STUDY THE DOCTOR STUDIED THIS POOR DIET HYPOTHESIS WITH CHICKENS AS A RESULT THE CHICKENS WITH THE POOR DIET ENDED UP HAVING THE SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X AND AS SOON AS THEY WENT BACK TO A REGULAR DIET THE SYMPTOMS SEEMED TO DESIST IN THE THIRD STUDY THE DOCTOR STUDIED THE POOR DIET HYPOTHESIS WITH UNAFFECTED MALES FROM THE VILLAGE IN THE END THE MALES WHO WERE ON THE POOR DIET WERE THE ONES SUFFERING FROM THE SYMPTOMS IN THE FIRST STUDY THE DOCTOR ONLY TOLD OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INFECTED IN ONE VILLAGE THIS COULD BE A VERY POOR VILLAGE WHERE MOST PEOPLE DONT HAVE MUCH MONEY THEREFORE THEY HAVE AN EXTREMELY POOR DIET THIS COULD BE THE REASON FOR SOMEONE IN THE SAME HOUSE OR A NEIGHBORING HOUSE TO HAVE THE DISEASE X	3159	DOCTOR 3S STUDY PUTS PEOPLE WITH POOR LIVING CONDITIONS IN A CLEAN HOUSE SO THERE COULDNT BE ANY GERMS OR BACTERIA THAT COULD CAUSE THE DISEASE AND IF DOCTOR 2S STUDY WAS CORRECT THEN WHY DID ONLY SOME OF THE MEN IN THE HOUSE GET THE DISEASE THEY ALL ATE THE SAME FOOD NOT ALL THE CHICKENS ATE THE SAME FOOD I DONT KNOW HOW THIS GUY IS EVEN A DOCTOR OR GOT A GRANT TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT DOCTOR 1 NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT THESE PEOPLE WHERE EATING OR HOW THEY LIVED ANYONE COULD DO A RETARDED EXPERIMENT LIKE THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER POWER LINE OFTEN DEVELOP CANCER BUT THEY DONT ATTRIBUTE THE CANCER TO GENETICS THEY DID MORE STUDIES AND FOUND THAT IT IS CAUSED BY RADIATION DOCTOR 1 AND 2 HAD SO MANY VARIABLES THAT NEEDED TO BE TESTED AND THE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED ANY OF THEM	3160	AFTER READING THE THREE STUDIES DIETARY DEFICIENCY APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED IN THE THIRD STUDY APPEARS TO BE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND CONCLUSIVE STUDY 3 WAS BASED ON THE IDEA OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF FOOD WHICH LEAD DIRECTLY TO RESULTS POSITIVE FOR THE DISEASE STUDY 3 ALSO SEEMED THE MOST WHOLESOME BECAUSE THERE WAS A CONTROL GROUP USED FOR COMPARISON AGAINST THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INDIVIDUALS WHO MAINTAINED A NORMAL WELL BALANCED DIET ACTED AS THE CONTROL WHILE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE OTHER GROUP HAD THEIR DIETS ALTERED NOTE THERE WAS A CONTROL BOTTLE IN STUDY 2 BUT DID CHICKEN 5 DEVELOP SYMPTOMS FOR THE DISEASE BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIA IT WAS GIVEN OR BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN DIET I DIDNT FEEL LIKE A SOUND CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN FROM THIS STUDY I DIDNT FIND THE INFORMATION GIVEN IN STUDY 1 TO BE VERY USEFUL IT DIDNT REALLY HELP DETERMINE THE ROOT OF THE DISEASE WAS IT GENETIC CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS OR MAYBE THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS LIVED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND SHARED SIMILAR DIETARY HABITS	3161	I THINK IT IS CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS BECAUSE ALL STUDIES COULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY THIS FACTOR IN STUDY ONE THE DISEASE COULD HAVE BEEN PASSED ON THROUGH CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN STUDY TWO THE DISEASE COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A BACTERIA BUT THE STUDY DID NOT ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT THE CHICKENS ALL LIVED IN THE SAME AREA THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DISEASE IS SPREAD BY CONTACT IS STILL POSSIBLE IN STUDY THREE THE DISEASE COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A BACTERIA IN THE FOOD AND BEEN SPREAD BY ALL THE MEN LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE STUDY 3 COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ACCURATE IF THE MEN ALL LIVED IN ISOLATION OF EACH OTHER SO WE COULD SEE IF THE DISEASE ONLY SHOWED UP WHEN THERE WAS CONTACT THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THE DISEASE COULD BE GENETIC FAMILY RELATIONS ARE NOT SPECIFIED BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THIS IS A SERIOUS FLAW ON THE REPORTING FOR THE CONDUCTORS OF THESE SURVEYS	3162	IN THE STUDY DONE BY DOCTOR 3 THE 20 MEN WHO LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE RIDDLED WITH GERMS AND BACTERIA DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF DISEASE X THEY HAD CONTACT WITH INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE EXPERIMENT BASED ON THIS I RULED OUT BACTERIA AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE IF BACTERIA WAS THE CAUSE THAN AT LEAST ONE OF THE 20 MEN WOULD SHOW SIGNS OF DISEASE X BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO MANY FORMS OF BACTERIA THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL AS THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS ALTHOUGH GENETIC IS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF DISEASE X I RULED IT OUT BECAUSE OF DOCTOR 1S STUDY OF THE 115 DISEASED INDIVIDUALS 64 HAD NO REPORTED CASES OF DISEASED RELATIVES I CONCLUDED THAT DISEASE X WAS CAUSED BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS OF THE DOCTORS STUDIES IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY MOST OF THE AFFECTED PERSONS LIVED IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHERS WITH THE DISEASE I CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS DIETARY BECAUSE OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE POOR AREAS OF BIG CITIES DURING THE TENEMENT AGE MANY DISEASES RAN RAMPANT BECAUSE OF THE POOR SANITATION BUT POOR DIET IS LINKED TO LACK OF MONEY FAMILIES WITH POOR DIET OFTEN LIVED NEAR OR WITH OTHER FAMILIES WITH A POOR DIET THE LIVING AREAS WERE CHEAP AND ALLOWED FOR MONEY TO BE USED ON ANY KIND OF FOOD DOCTOR 3S STUDY REINFORCED MY ASSUMPTION OF MALNOURISHMENT AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X ALTHOUGH THE 20 MEN WITH GOOD FOOD HAD POOR HOUSING HAD GOOD FOOD NONE OF THEM HAD DISEASE X WHEN THE EXPERIMENT WAS CONCLUDED THIS RULES OUT POOR HOUSING AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X BECAUSE THE 11 INDIVIDUALS LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE THEY ATE POOR FOOD MOST OF THEM DEVELOPED DISEASE X THE 5 THAT WERE FREE FROM THE DISEASE IS PROBABLY DUE TO A PRIOR IMMUNITY OF THE DISEASE OR JUST A STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEMS	3163	I BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS THAT IS TRANSMITTED IN A GERM HOWEVER I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT A POOR DIET CAN INFLUENCE OR INCREASE THE LIKELINESS OF CONTRACTING THE DISEASE BY NOT EATING A HEALTHY DIET THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL BECOME WEAKER IN FIGHTING FOREIGN GERMS AND BACTERIA IN CASE STUDY ONE IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT THE DISEASE IS PASSED THROUGH DAILY HUMAN CONTACT WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH EATING HABITS EVEN THOUGH THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MORE COMMON WAY OF CONTRACTING THE DISEASE CASE STUDY THREE SHOWED THAT OVER A PERIOD OF 5 MONTHS A POOR EATING HABIT DOES IN FACT INCREASES THE CHANCES OF GETTING THE DISEASE AND EVEN CAUSES THE DISEASE ALSO IN THE SECOND STUDY WITH THE CHICKENS IT WAS ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE DISEASE WAS PASSED THROUGH CONTAMINATED FOOD WHICH ALSO MAKES THE TRANSMISSION THROUGH A BACTERIUM POSSIBLE I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MAYBE A POOR EATING HABIT AND THE BACTERIUM OR GERM HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE MEN IN THE THIRD CASE STUDY WERE KEPT IN A CLEAN HOUSE WITH NO OTHER HUMAN CONTACT AND WERE GIVEN A POOR DIET THE ONLY OPTION OF TRANSMISSION OF THE DISEASE COULD BE THROUGH A DIETARY DEFICIENCY I BELIEVE THAT A WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM CAUSED BY SOME SORT OF DIETARY DEFICIENCY GIVES RISE TO THE GERM OR BACTERIUM CAUSES THE DISEASE AND THEN PROCEEDS TO BECOME CONTAGIOUS THROUGH DAILY HUMAN CONTACT I BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE IN THE FIRST STUDY THE DISEASE WAS TRANSMITTED THROUGH DAILY HUMAN CONTACT IN THE SECOND STUDY THE CORNMEAL HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA SAMPLES FOUND IN FOOD THAT THE PATIENTS ATE AT THE TIME THEY CONTRACTED THE DISEASE AND FINALLY IN THE THIRD CASE STUDY THE MEN BECAME SICK OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS BECAUSE OF A POOR DIET THEREFORE I BELIEVE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE CAN BE CONTRACTED THROUGH A POOR DIET WHICH WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY OUR ANTIBODIES CANNOT FIGHT OFF THE BACTERIUM WHICH PROMOTES THE DISEASE WHEN THE DISEASE HAS BEEN CONTRACTED IT BECOMES CONTAGIOUS THROUGH HUMAN DAILY CONTACT	3164	I BELIEVE THE EXPERIMENT THAT SEEMED TO SHOW THE MOST RESULTS WAS EXPERIMENT ONE BECAUSE OUT OF AN ENTIRE CITY OF 5 514 PEOPLE 115 HAD DISEASE X AND A VERY LARGE NUMBER 80 LIVED RIGHT IN THE SAME HOUSE OR RIGHT NEXT DOOR I THINK THOSE ARE PRETTY LARGE NUMBERS ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH JUST A FEW PEOPLE OR A FEW CHICKENS THAT WHOEVER WROTE IT ONLY SAID HE DID THE EXPERIMENT WITH ONE CHICKEN HE SHOULD HAVE DONE BACTERIA 5 WITH MORE CHICKENS NOT LIKE I WANT TO HURT THE CHICKENS I JUST SEEMS LIKE BACTERIA AND CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER SEEMS LIKE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE I AM TAKING IN TO CONSIDERATION THOUGH THAT IF THESE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X LIVED RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER OR IN THE SAME HOUSE THAT THEY COULD BE ON THE SAME DIET TOO AND NUTRITION COULD BE THE PROBLEM	3165	IN ALL THREE OF THE STUDIES THE INDIVIDUALS CHICKENS OR PEOPLE BEING STUDIED WERE ALL CONSUMING FOOD THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HARBOR A VIRUS OR BAD BACTERIA IN THE THIRD STUDY THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY STUDY FOOD WAS STILL APART OF THERE LIVES SO ALTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE ACTUAL DEFICIENCY THAT CAUSED THE DISEASE I DO BELIEVE THAT A VIRUS OR BACTERIA COULD HAVE TRAVELED ON THE FOOD THAT THEY WERE EATING IN THE FIRST STUDY THE INFECTED PEOPLE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT ONE ANOTHER LIVING IN AND AROUND ONE ANOTHER THEY WERE SURELY EATING FROM THE SAME FOOD SOURCES ALSO PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN EATING THE SAME FOOD OR BACTERIA INFECTED BY THE WATER SOURCE IN THAT AREA IN THE SECOND STUDY THE ONLY CHICKEN THAT GO SICK WAS THE ONE WHO ATE THE BACTERIA CONTAMINATED FOOD	3166	I DETERMINED FROM THE STUDIES OF THE THREE DOCTORS THAT THE DISEASE HAD TO BE DUE TO POOR DIET I THOUGHT AFTER THE SECOND DOCTORS STUDY THAT THIS WAS MOST LIKELY TRUE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST NOT VERY LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE IS GENETIC OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE A LARGER NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING THE DISEASE IN THE SAME FAMILY FROM DOCTOR 1 STUDY IT WAS SEEN THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAT THE PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE WOULD LIVE NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER RATHER THEN IN THE SAME FAMILY STILL AT THIS POINT I THOUGHT IT COULD BE EITHER DIET OR DUE TO VIRUS BACTERIUM AFTER DOCTOR STUDY 2 THIS SEEMED LESS LIKELY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE BACTERIA FROM THE BLOOD WAS PUT IN THE CORN MEAL IT SEEMED STRANGE THAT ONLY ONE OF THE CHICKENS WOULD GET THE DISEASE IF THEY WERE ALL IN CONTACT WITH THE BACTERIA ALSO THE CHICKEN THAT WAS AFFECTED IMPROVED ON GOOD NUTRITION AFTER THE THIRD STUDY IT SEEMED EVEN MORE LIKELY THERE WAS A LOW RISK FOR THE ELEVEN MEN TO GET SICK BECAUSE OF SOMETHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT OTHER THEN THE FOOD I BELIEVE THAT HIS WAS CAUSED BY THE DIET BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS THAT THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X WERE SHOWING IF A PERSON HAS TOO MUCH YEAST IN THEIR DIET ALL OF THE FOOD THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE EATING HAD A LOT OF YEAST IN IT	3167	I CHOOSE NOT TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE DISEASES CAUSE IN QUESTION 4 BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO DRAW A SOLID CONCLUSION TO DRAW A CONCLUSION OF DISEASES CAUSE I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW EACH STUDY WAS CONDUCTED MORE GENERAL INFORMATION AND HOW IT MIGHT DISPROVE OTHER THEORIES FOR INSTANCE IN THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY HOW MANY AFFECTED PEOPLE WERE RELATED TO EACH OTHER AND WHAT WERE THEIR FAMILY HISTORYS I ALSO DO NOT THINK THESE WERE COMPLETE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WAS THE BACTERIUM IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY PRESENT IN ALL THE AFFECTED BLOOD OR FOOD HE STATES HE HAS BEEN COLLECTING BACTERIA FOR YEARS HOW OLD WAS THE SAMPLE HE USED IN THE STUDY COULD IT HAVE MUTATED	3168	IN STUDY 1 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE SAME AREA OF THE STATE IT COULD BE A DEFICIENCY IN THE DIET OF THE PEOPLE BUT IT COULD ALSO BE WITH THAT PARTICULAR DEFICIENCY AND A CERTAIN BACTERIA DO NOT MIX WELL TOGETHER I SAY BACTERIA BECAUSE IT IS IN VILLAGES WITH NEIGHBORS AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WITH IT SO IT COULD BE PASSED AS A VIRUS IN STUDY 2 I COULD ONLY FIGURE THAT IT WAS FROM A CERTAIN BACTERIA BECAUSE ONLY SOME OF THE CHICKENS GOT DISEASE X THAT WERE FED THE BACTERIA FROM 5 THAT WOULD MEAN IT IS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF BACTERIA AT LEAST IN STUDY 3 IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE DIETARY DEFICIENCIES THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH DISEASE X AND NOT REALLY A BACTERIA BECAUSE THERE WERE NO REAL GERMS OTHER THAT THEIR OWN THE PLACE WAS CLEAN AND THEY WERE NOT EXPOSED TO ANYONE MAYBE WITH THE CHICKENS IT COLD HAVE BEEN THE DIET ALSO THEN THE BACTERIA ENTERING WITH THE DIET DEFICIENCY WAS A BAD COMBINATION	3169	I BELIEVE THAT THIS DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIA OR VIRUS BECAUSE A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED WITH THE DISEASE IN STUDY 1 THE PEOPLE AFFECTED ALL LIVED WITH OR NEAR EACH OTHER OR HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH A DISEASED PERSON BACTERIA COULD EASILY BE PASSED ON FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT IN STUDY 2 PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY CHICKENS WERE INFECTED WITH DIFFERENT BACTERIA ONE BECOMING SICK WITH A DISEASE SIMILAR TO DISEASE X AFTER DISCONTINUING TO GIVE THAT CHICKEN THE BACTERIA AND NOW GIVING IT A HEALTHY DIET THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE CEASED IN STUDY 3 YOUNG TO MIDDLE AGED HEALTHY MEN WERE SEPARATED INTO TWO HOMES AND FED VERY DIFFERENT DIETS ALTHOUGH THE MEN WHO LIVED IN THE WELL KEPT HOME WERE NOT OUTRIGHT EXPOSED TO BACTERIA I BELIEVE THAT THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS BECAME WEAK AFTER BEING FED A POOR DIET AND THEREFORE COULD NOT FIGHT OFF EVEN THE SMALLEST OF INFECTIONS THAT DISEASE X COULD CAUSE THE MEN LIVING IN THE DIRTY HOME WERE WELL FED SO THEIR SYSTEMS COULD IN FACT FIGHT OFF INFECTION TO DETER THE DISEASE FROM TAKING OVER THEIR SYSTEMS	3170	I BELIEVE THE DISEASE IS ULTIMATELY CAUSED BY BACTERIAL VIRAL INFECTION SUCH AS THAT WHICH CAN OCCUR IN INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS DISTURBANCE IN THE BALANCE OF FRIENDLY AND HARMFUL INTESTINAL BACTERIA POTENTIATED BY POOR NUTRITION ESPECIALLY A DIET HIGH IN REFINED CARBOHYDRATES THE PATHOGENIC ORGANISM MAY ENTER THROUGH THE VENUES OF WATER SUPPLY OR AIR NEITHER OF WHICH WERE REGULATED IN THE 3 STUDIES AND BYPASS A CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS DEFENSE SYSTEM IMMUNE SYSTEM HYDROCHLORIC ACID NEUTRALIZATION OF PATHOGENS ETC AT WHICH POINT IT BEGINS TO PROSPER IN THE MALNOURISHED INDIVIDUALS BODY ALTHOUGH MALNUTRITION MAY NOT APPLY IN THE CASE OF STUDY 2 THE BACTERIA SAMPLES INTRODUCED TO THE CHICKENS DIETS MAY HAVE CONTAINED PATHOGENS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO CAUSE DISEASE IN SOME BUT NOT ALL SUBJECTS STUDY 2 WAS ALSO OF A RELATIVELY SHORT DURATION COMPARED TO THAT OF STUDY 3	3171	I BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE X IS LIKELY CAUSED FROM A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRST STUDY ALL OF THE PEOPLE WERE FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY MOST PATIENTS AFFECTED EITHER LIVED WITH AN AFFECTED PERSON OR CLOSE TO AN AFFECTED PERSON THESE PEOPLE WOULD ALL SHARE A WATER SOURCE AND MOST LIKELY EAT FOOD FROM THAT SAME SOURCES IN THE SECOND STUDY CHICKEN 5 DEVELOPED THAT DISEASE AFTER EATING A BACTERIA RIDDEN CORN MEAL AFTER THIS DIET WAS STOPPED THE CHICKENS SYMPTOMS IMPROVED IN THE THIRD STUDY MORE THAN HALF OF THE MEN WHO ATE THE POOR DIET DEVELOPED THE DISEASE	3172	I THINK THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY IS MERELY A SUBSET OF THE THIRD DOCTORS IN THE FIRST STUDY VARIABLES CONSIDERED WERE 1 PEOPLE WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR2 PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE RELATION TO THE DISEASED THE STUDY DID NOT RULE OUT ANY OF THE POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE GENETIC BACTERIAL OR DIETARY DISEASES CAN EXIST UNDER THE CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE IN ADDITION THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS HOMOGENEOUS EVERY SUBJECT CAME FROM ONE COUNTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA THE THIRD STUDY ON THE OTHER HAND WAS MORE CONCLUSIVE SINCE SUBJECT BASE WAS HETEROGENEOUS AND FOOD WAS THE MAIN VARIANT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS	3173	IN THREE CASES THE THIRD CASE IS THE MOST LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE ACCORDING TO THE THIRD DOCTOR REPORT ALL THE MEN HAVE THE DISEASE X ARE LIVING IN A SANITARY ENVIRONMENT CLEAN HOUSE FOOD AND WATER ARE PROVIDE BY THE RESEARCH TEAM ETC AND NO CONTACT BUT THEY HAVE POOR DIET THEREFORE DIETARY DEFICIENCY HAS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IN CONTRARY THE MEN WHO LIVE TOGETHER HAVE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER LIVING IN A DIRTY HOUSE BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE THE DISEASE X BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BETTER DIET THEREFORE BACTERIUM VIRUS CANNOT BE THE CAUSE IT HAS TO BE THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSE	3174	IT IS DEFICIENCY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THAT WITH DOCTOR 1S EXPERIMENT THAT THERE WERE LESS PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE WITH DEFICIENCY BUT SINCE THEY LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE THERE IS A PROBABILITY THAT THEY ARE FEEDING ON THE SAME TYPE OF FOOD CULTURE IS A PURE DETERMINANT TO THIS TYPE OF SITUATION ACCORDING TO DOCTOR 2S EXPERIMENT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SICK CHICKEN IS DEFICIENT IN A PARTICULAR MINERALS CONTAINED IN FOOD AND THAT ALLOWED THE BACTERIA TO AFFECT IT IN DOCTOR 3S EXPERIMENT HE CARRIED ALMOST ALL HER EXPERIMENT TO STUDY THE DEFICIENCY AND THE PEOPLE THAT HE KEPT ON DEFICIENT FOODS CONTRACTED THE DISEASE AND SINCE THEY WERE KEPT CLEAN AND THERE RIVALS WHO WERENT ALL THAT CLEAN DIDNT GET IT THEN IT ALL LIES INTO DEFICIENCY IN FOOD	3175	I BELIEVE THE DISEASE X IS GENETIC I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION BECAUSE IN THE FIRST STUDY WE OBSERVED THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INFECTED WITH DISEASE X LIVED NEXT TO SOMEONE WITH THE DISEASE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE OR HAD CONTACT WITH RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE IN THE SECOND STUDY WE SAW THAT NINE HEALTHY CHICKENS WERE FED CONTAMINATED FOOD WITH BACTERIA AND IT RESULTED IN ONLY ONE SICK CHICKEN IF THE DISEASE WAS BACTERIUM VIRUS THEN ALL OF THE CHICKENS WOULD HAVE BEEN SICK IN THE THIRD STUDY WE OBSERVED THAT 11 MEN WERE FED A POOR DIET LIVED IN THE SAME CLEAN HOUSE AND HAD NO CONTACT WITH OTHERS AND 20 MEN LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE TOGETHER ATE A RICH DIET AND HAD CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE THE RESULT WAS 6 MEN WITH THE POOR DIET SHOWED DISEASE X AND 5 DID NOT NONE OF THE MEN WITH THE RICH DIET SHOWED DISEASE X WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE DISEASE IS NOT DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IF IT WAS THEN ALL 11 MEN WITH THE POOR DIET WOULD HAVE HAD THE DISEASE AND IF IT WAS BACTERIUM VIRUS THEN THE OTHER MEN LIVING THERE THAT WERE NOT ALREADY AFFECTED WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT THERE WAS NOT GENETIC TEST IN ANY OF THESE STUDIES THEREFORE WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE PARENTS OF ANY OF THE DISEASED PEOPLE OR ANIMALS HAD THE DISEASE THEREFORE WE CAN NOT REALLY CONCLUDE HOW THIS DISEASE IS CAUSED AT THIS TIME	3176	I THINK ITS VIRAL BACTERIUM BUT CAN BE SUPPRESSED BY A GOOD DIET WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF NUTRIENTS PEOPLE LIVING NEAR EACH OTHER AND IN THE SAME HOUSE GOT IT IN ADDITION THE NEIGHBORS AND MEMBERS OF THE SAME HOUSE HOLD WERE PROBABLY ON SIMILAR DIETS WHICH IN THIS CASE IS PRESUMABLY POOR AND THEREFORE A HEALTHY DIET DIDNT SUPPRESS THE SYMPTOMS PERHAPS THE REASON THAT ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT THE DISEASE BECAUSE PEOPLE ALSO HAVE TO BE PRE DISPOSED TO THE DISEASE WHICH WOULD BRING IN A GENETIC FACTOR ITS NOT THE WATER NOR FROM THE SEWAGE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE MEN FROM THE HEALTHY HOUSE ALSO HAD THE SAME WATER	3177	I THINK THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS I CHOSE THIS BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE STUDY 1 SHOWS THAT 80 OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED LIVED EITHER IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEXT DOOR AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO HAD DISEASE X IF IT WAS BACTERIA OR VIRUS THEN THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER THEREFORE SPREADING THE DISEASE ANOTHER THING THAT ALSO SUPPORTS THIS IS STUDY 2 ONE OF THE CHICKENS GIVEN INFECTED CORNMEAL DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X THE CHICKEN WAS NOT DEPRIVED OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF FOOD THAT IT WOULD NORMALLY EAT SO IT DOESNT SHOW DIET DEFICIENCY ALSO ONCE IT STOPPED INGESTING THE INFECTED FOOD IT GOT BETTER I THINK THAT THIS SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRUS	3178	ON THE SURFACE BACTERIUM VIRUS SEEMS TO BE THE MODEL THAT BEST FITS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X IN DOCTOR ONES STUDY THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE DISEASE IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THIS MODE IS STRONG THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE DISEASE HAD CONTACT WITH OTHERS IN THEIR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDING WHO WERE AFFECTED THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE UNAWARE OF NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH INFECTED OTHERS COULD VERY WELL HAVE GOTTEN THE DISEASE THROUGH CONTACT WITH STRANGERS GENETIC CAUSE CAN BE RULED OUT IN THIS STUDY FOR MEANS OF CONTACT EXTENDS BEYOND FAMILY IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE EVIDENCE LEANS TO BACTERIUM VIRUS AS WELL IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE MEN THAT HAVE SHOWN SYMPTOMS SEEM TO BE ILL FROM A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE DISEASE COULD BE THE RESULT OF SOMETHING ABSENT IN THE FOODS WHEN THINKING OF THIS I LOOKED BACK ON DOCTOR ONE AND THOUGHT THAT THOSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE LIVED IN AN ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED AREA AND EXPOSED TO POOR DIETS	3179	I FIND THE MOST OVERALL CONCLUSIVE PIECE OF DATA TO BE THAT THE MEN IN STUDY 3 AFTER THEIR DIET CHANGED BECAME QUITE ILL ALSO THIS THEORY WILL ALSO EXPLAIN THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN STUDY 1 WHERE LOCATION HAS A STRONG EFFECT ON THE AVAILABLE FOOD AND RESOURCE FOR NUTRITION	3180	IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES THAT HAD BEEN PERFORMED THE CONCLUSION A PERSON COULD REACH OR AT LEAST AS A BASE ANSWER WOULD BE THAT THE DISEASE WOULD NOT BE GENETIC THE FIRST DOCTOR FOUND THAT IN HIS STUDY AND ASSUMING IN THE OTHER TWO STUDIES THE CHICKENS WERE NOT RELATED NOR WERE THE 31 MALE VOLUNTEERS IN THE LAST TWO STUDIES IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT IS GIVEN IT COULD BE A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THE MALES IN STUDY 3 ALL HAD A CONTROLLED DIET BUT ALSO THEY DID NOT TEST FOR BACTERIUM IN THE FOOD GIVEN TO THE MALES WHO HAD THE POOR DIET THERE IS A SIMILARITY IN THE FOOD GIVEN IN CASE 2 AND CASE 3 BOTH SUBJECTS RECEIVED SOME OF THE SAME TYPE OF FODDER TO EAT AND THAT MAY CAUSE A WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH MAY ALLOW THE DISEASE TO FLOURISH WITHIN THE BODY WHILE DIFFERENT BACTERIA WERE TRIED OUT IN STUDY 2 THE BACTERIA LABELED NUMBER 5 COULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN ANY OF THE FOOD THAT WAS EATEN IN THE STUDY OF NUMBER 2 THE DOCTOR TOOK THE DIFFERENT BACTERIA SAMPLES FROM THE FOOD THAT THE PATIENTS ATE AND THEN GREW EACH INDIVIDUAL BACTERIUM THIS WAS GROWN ON CORN AND CORN MEAL WAS FED TO THE PATIENTS OF STUDY 3 AND IT IS KNOWN THAT THE STRAIN CAN GROW UPON CORN AND CORNMEAL ALSO AS A SIDE BY THE FOOD GIVEN TO THE PATIENTS WAS NOT TOLD TO BE STERILE SO WITH A NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY A HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS WEAKENED ALLOWING FOR INFECTIOUS AGENTS TO ATTACK THE BODY	3181	I FOUND THE DATA FROM BOTH STUDY ONE AND STUDY 2 TO BE SOMEWHAT INCONCLUSIVE ALTHOUGH STUDY 2 WAS MUCH MORE CONCLUSIVE TO ME THAN STUDY 1 STUDY 2 STILL SEEMED A BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN NECESSARY AND I WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I FOUND IT A BIT HARD TO FOLLOW ON MY FIRST READ I ONLY CAME TO UNDERSTAND STUDY 2 AFTER HAVING READ STUDY 3I WAS ABLE TO REACH A CONCLUSION FROM STUDY 3 THIS STUDY SEEMED TO PROVIDE AN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS CLEAR TO ME THERE WERE 2 GROUPS WITH CLEAR VARIABLES IN GROUP ONE THEY WERE PLACED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS CLEAN AND THUS LESS BACTERIA ALLOWED TO MATURE GROUP 2 WAS PLACED IN A DIRTY ENVIRONMENT WITH LOTS OF BACTERIA BEING ALLOWED TO MATURE FROM THIS I WOULD THINK THAT IF THE DISEASE WAS ONE THAT WOULD BE PASSED BY GERMS THAT GROUP 2 WOULD BE THE ONE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE DISEASE BUT SINCE THEY DID NOT THIS RULED OUT FOR ME THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT BEING PASSED ON BY GERMS ADDITIONALLY GROUP ONE WAS PROVIDED A BAD DIET AND GROUP 2 A GOOD DIET SINCE GROUP ONE DID MANIFEST SOME DISEASE MEMBERS AND WE WERE ABLE TO RULE OUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF GERMS WE WERE LEFT ONLY WITH THE FACT THAT GROUP ONE WAS GIVEN A BAD DIET IT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER TO NOTE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE SAYING THAT THE DISEASE HAD NO LIKELY GENETIC LINKAGE FROM STUDY 3 I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT COULD STILL BE POSSIBLE THAT THEY SHARED A GENETIC PROCLIVITY FOR MANIFESTING THE DISEASE UNDER POOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BUT SINCE IN STUDY ONE ONLY 7 OF THE DISEASED POPULATION HAD RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE THAT SEEMED TO MAKE ANY GENETIC LINK UNLIKELY THUS IN THE END I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE DISEASE WAS A BY PRODUCT OF POOR DIET ONLY	3182	BASED ON THE DATA I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS A BACTERIA THAT CAUSES THE DISEASE ITSELF IT CANT BE GENETIC IN THAT IF ITS GENETIC THEN ONLY GENES WOULD CAUSE THE DISEASE BY SHOWING THAT AN INTAKE OF CERTAIN INFECTED FOODS CAUSES THE DISEASE THEN IT CANT BE GENETIC SINCE THE FOOD GIVEN TO THE TEST SUBJECTS IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY WAS INFECTED AND DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAME DOWN WITH THE DISEASE ITSELF WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING TOGETHER NEAR INFECTED PEOPLE OR HAD CONTACT WITH THEM IT SUGGESTS ITS EITHER VIRAL OR BACTERIAL THEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAME DOWN WITH THE DISEASE WERE THE ONES WHO WERE EATING THE POOR DIET IT WASNT VIRAL BECAUSE THE ROOM WAS STERILE AND CLEANED OFTEN IF IT WAS VIRAL THEN THE MEN WHO WERE IN THE DIRTY AREA AND WERE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE GENERAL POPULATION WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED SOMETHING THE ISOLATED MEN WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DEVELOPED IT SO VIRAL ISNT A LIKELY MODE OF TRANSMISSION TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER MY THEORY IS THIS THE CAUSE IS DEFINITELY BACTERIAL BUT ONLY ONE STRAIN OF THE BACTERIA SINCE THE CHICKENS IN EXPERIMENT 2 ONLY GOT THE DISEASE FROM BACTERIA 5 I PROPOSE THE SOLUTION IS THIS THE DISEASE IS SPREAD THROUGH BACTERIA BUT IN COMBINATION WITH DIET I SUSPECT THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDERNOURISHED AND EAT MOSTLY EMPTY CARBOHYDRATES SET UP AN IMBALANCE THAT ALLOWS CERTAIN BACTERIA TO BUILD UP POSSIBLY BACTERIA THAT NORMALLY OCCURS IN THE GRAINS THEY WERE EATING BUT DUE TO THE LACK OF ANYTHING ELSE THE BACTERIA GREW UNCHECKED THIS BACTERIA INFECTS THEM AND IS THEN TRANSMISSIBLE IF THIS IS TRUE THEN I WOULD STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT IF THE 11 MEN WHO PARTOOK OF THE POOR DIET WERE ALLOWED TO INTERACT WITH A CONTROLLED NUMBER OF MEN WITH THE GOOD DIET THEN YOU WOULD SEE THEM COME DOWN WITH THE DISEASE THUS PROVING IT WAS A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE THEY DID NOT DO THIS BUT HAD THEY I AM VERY CONFIDENT THEY ALSO WOULD SHOW SIGNS OF THE DISEASE EVEN THOUGH THE DIET WAS DIFFERENT	3183	STUDY 1 HAD A VERY LARGE RATIO OF THOSE WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH OTHERS WHO HAD THE DISEASE THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DISEASE IS EASILY CONTRACTED MORE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE DISEASE WHO PASS IT ON THROUGH COUGH CONTAMINATED FOOD TOUCHING ETC ALTHOUGH A POOR DIET MAY CONTRIBUTE AS WELL THIS STILL CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FAMILY MEMBERS PASSING IT ON IF THEY ALL EAT SOMEWHAT OF THE SAME FOODS MOST LIKELY I WOULD SAY THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY BACTERIUM VIRAL	3184	THERE SEEM TO BE FLAWS IN EACH OF THESE STUDIES THE FIRST ONE WHICH LOOKS FOR A GENETIC CAUSE IS TAKEN FROM A VERY SMALL GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND THEREFORE IT COULD BE GENETIC DIETARY OR SOMETHING ENVIRONMENTAL THE SECOND STUDY USES TOO SMALL A SAMPLE SIZE ONLY ONE CHICKEN PER BACTERIUM THE THIRD STUDY IS ALSO FLAWED BY PUTTING THE 2 GROUPS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS HOWEVER IN LOOKING AT THE NUMBER AFFECTED UNAFFECTED OUT OF EACH SAMPLE SEEMS TO SHOW MORE DRAMATIC RESULTS IE 6 OUT OF 11 DISEASED 0 OUT OF 20 WITHOUT DISEASE	3185	I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE A CHANCE THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM STUDIES 2 AND 3 BOTH HAVE SUBJECTS EATING CORNMEAL PERHAPS TAINTED CORNMEAL IS THE CARRIER IT IS POSSIBLE AS ALL OF THE CONTROL SUBJECTS IN STUDY 3 DID NOT EAT THE CORNMEAL BUT HALF OF THOSE WHO DID EAT IT GOT THE DISEASE IN THE CASE OF THE CHICKENS THE BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM THE SICK INDIVIDUALS IS MIXED WITH CORNMEAL BEFORE BEING FED TO THE CHICKENS SINCE ONE OF THE CHICKENS BECAME SICK THIS SHOWS THAT CORNMEAL WAS A GOOD GROWTH MEDIUM FOR THE BACTERIA ALSO HOW WOULD THE CHICKEN BECOME SICK IF THIS WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY ARE THEIR DIETARY NEEDS COMPARABLE TO HUMANS THE OTHER CHICKENS THRIVED ON THE CORNMEAL DIET AS FOR STUDY 1 IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE GOT THEIR FOOD FROM THE SAME SOURCE AND IF THIS WAS A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE EATING CORNMEAL FOR MANY OF THEIR MEALS	3186	I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X WAS DIETARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE I DO BELIEVE THAT NUTRITION HAS A LOT TO DO WITH DISEASES AND THE SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X SOUND LIKE THEY ARE THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF DEFICIENCY STUDY 1 SIMPLY STATED THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE LIVED NEAR OR WITH EACH OTHER THIS COULD MEAN THAT THE DISEASE WAS SOME SORT OF VIRUS BUT IT ALSO LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR MANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES STUDY 2 WAS CONVINCING BUT I ALSO DONT KNOW IF I BELIEVE THE METHOD USED WORKED WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO DRAW A BACTERIA FROM SOMEONES BLOOD WITH THE DISEASE AND FEED IT TO CHICKENS THE BACTERIA COULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN THE HUMAN WITH THE DISEASE STUDY 2 PROVES IT WAS THAT BACTERIA BUT IT STILL DOESNT PROVE WHY OR HOW HUMANS GOT DISEASE X STUDY 3 SEEMED TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE 6 MONTHS SEEMS A PROPER TIME ON A POOR DIET THAT THE DEFICIENCY WOULD START TO SHOW SYMPTOMS I MAY ALSO FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE IN LECTURE PROFESSOR WHITE MENTIONED SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE ALL THESE FAMILY MEMBERS HAD THE SAME DISEASE AND IT WAS ASSUMED TO BE GENETIC AND LATER PROVED TO BE DIETARY THE POWER OF SUGGESTION WAYS HEAVY SO THIS MAY BE WHY I FEEL IT WAS DIETARY LASTLY THE TIME PERIOD WAS A TIME IN HISTORY THAT PEOPLE WERE POOR AND SUFFERED FROM POOR NUTRITION	3187	I THINK DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY BECAUSE IN THE FIRST STUDY THE DOCTOR DID NOT ANALYZE THE DIET OF THE PEOPLE WHO WHERE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEARBY THAT HAD THE X DISEASE I ALSO THINK THAT THE CHICKEN IN THE 2ND STUDY HAD A POOR DIET TOO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEARBY HAVE A POOR DIET OR ABOUT THE SAME DIET	3188	I CHOSE THE BACTERIUM VIRUS AS MY ANSWER BECAUSE OUT OF THE THREE STUDIES DONE ONE OF THEM FELL INTO THE CATEGORY THAT THE STUDY PROVED MORE IN NUMBERS FOR BOTH STUDIES 2 AND 3 OF THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY THERE WASNT ENOUGH DATA TO CONVINCE ME THAT STUDY WAS MORE PROFICIENT I FELT THAT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS COULDVE CAUSED THOSE TYPE OF SYMPTOMS WHEN YOU DONT EAT A WELL NUTRITIONAL DIET YOU BECOME SICK IN STUDY NUMBER ONE IT PROVES THAT OUT OF THE 115 DISEASED 99 OF THE PATIENTS WERE IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD THE DISEASE WHILE THE OTHER 16 DIDNT FOR STUDY NUMBER TWO AN THREE NOT ENOUGH PATIENTS OR CHICKENS HAD THE DISEASE DUE TO AN IMBALANCE DIET IM NOT SAYING THAT THEY COULDNT HAVE GOTTEN THE DISEASE BUT NUMBERS ARE EVERYTHING	3189	BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DOCTOR 1S STUDY 80 OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISEASE X HAVE SOMEONE ELSE WITH DISEASE X LIVING EITHER IN THE SAME HOUSE OF NEXT DOOR I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER RELATIVES OR VERY GOOD FRIENDS WHO HAVE SIMILAR EATING HABIT THEY EAT SIMILAR FOOD EVERYDAY OR DONT EAT ON TIME ETC ACCORDING TO DOCTOR 2S STUDY ONE OF THE CHICKEN GOT THE DISEASE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN EATING FOOD THAT CONTAINS CERTAIN BACTERIA I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE BACTERIA IN THE FOOD EAT OR KILL SOME IMPORTANT NUTRITION THAT THE CHICKEN NEEDS THATS WHY THE CHICKEN GOT DISEASE X ACCORDING TO DOCTOR 3S STUDY 6 OUT OF THE 11 MEN WHO HAD BEEN EATING POOR DIET FOR 5 MONTHS GOT DISEASE X THIS SHOWS THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X	3190	THE THIRD STUDY WAS THE MOST DETAILED STUDY AND THEREFORE HAD MORE WEIGHT THAN THE FIRST TWO SINCE THIS ONE SEEMS TO POINT TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD THE OTHER TWO BE EXPLAINED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY AS WELL THE FIRST STUDY SEEMED MORE LIKE A BACTERIAL CAUSED DISEASE HOWEVER THESE PEOPLE ALSO WERE FROM SMALL VILLAGES IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY 1900S MOST LIKELY VERY POOR AREAS MOSTLY BLACK AND DIETS FULL OF STARCHES THE DISEASE CERTAINLY COULD BE EXPLAINED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE SECOND STUDY WAS MORE DETAILED BUT THERE WAS ALREADY A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT WAS BACTERIAL RATHER THAN DIETARY SINCE THE CHICKEN WHICH DEVELOPED THE DISEASE IMPROVED AFTER BEING TREATED WITH A BETTER DIET THIS AGAIN COULD BE EXPLAINED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	3191	I BELIEVE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X THE REASON I THINK SO IS BECAUSE DOCTOR 3S STUDY HAS THE MOST CONVINCING EVIDENCE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE 5 OUT OF 6 MEN WHO ATE A POOR DIET DEVELOPED DISEASE X NOT A SINGLE MAN OUT OF THE 20 MEN FED A RICH DIET DEVELOPED THE DISEASE NONE OF THE MEN FROM EITHER GROUP HAD THE DISEASE BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT BEGAN THE MEN WHO WERE FED THE POOR DIET WERE NOT ALLOWED CONTACT WITH OUTSIDERS AND YET THEY STILL DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THE MEN WHO WERE FED A RICH DIET WERE ALLOWED CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND NONE OF THEM DEVELOPED THE DISEASE WHICH PROVES THAT IT IS NOT FROM A VIRUS OR BACTERIUM AS FAR AS I KNOW NONE OF THESE MEN ARE RELATED AND THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT AGES AND NEVER HAD THE DISEASE BEFORE SO THAT CAN PRETTY MUCH RULE OUT THE GENETIC SCENARIO AS FOR DOCTOR 2S STUDY THERE JUST ISNT ENOUGH HARD EVIDENCE WE DONT KNOW WHAT KIND OF FOOD THE BACTERIA 5 WAS TAKEN FROM THE CHICKENS DIET WAS DRASTICALLY CHANGED AND NOT EXACTLY HEALTHY WHICH GOES ALONG WITH DIETARY DEFICIENCY THEREFORE I BELIEVE DIETARY DEFICIENCY TO BE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF DISEASE X	3192	I WOULD GUESS THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THE THIRD STUDY HAD THE BEST CONTROLS OF ALL THREE STUDY BY USING TWO GROUPS OF MEN UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS EXCEPT FOR THE DIETARY MODIFICATIONS THE SCIENTIST ESTABLISHED A CONTROL FOR THE RESULTS THE PROBLEM THAT I SAW WITH THE CHICKEN STUDY IS THAT THERE WERE NO CHICKENS NOT FED THE BACTERIA LADEN DIET ALSO CHICKENS MAY NOT BE A GOOD TEST OF DISEASE WHICH OCCURS IN HUMANS THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST STUDY COULD ALSO BE EXPLAINED BY DIET THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO BE EXPLAINED BY GENETICS UNLESS FURTHER INVESTIGATION PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY NEIGHBORS WERE ALSO RELATIVES THINKING ABOUT DISEASES I COULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE IODINE DEFICIENCY AS AN EXAMPLE OF A DIETARY DEFICIENCY WHICH MIGHT PRESENT IN CLUSTERS LIKE THAT IN STUDY 1 I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE STUDY ONE TO LOOK FOR GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO RULE OUT A GENETIC CAUSE	3193	I FEEL THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE ABSOLUTE DEFINITE CAUSE I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS IN STUDY 3 IT COULD BE ANY OF THE 3 WAYS 92 OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X EITHER LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE OR LIVED NEXT TO SOMEONE WITH DISEASE X THIS TELLS ME THAT IT COULD BE BACTERIUM VIRUS RELATED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO EACH OTHER IT COULD ALSO BE FOOD RELATED BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE SAME AREA GENERALLY EAT A SIMILAR DIET ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD IT COULD ALSO BE GENETIC BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD DISEASE X ALSO HAD RELATIVES WITH DISEASE X THAT ALSO SUPPORTS A BACTERIUM VIRUS RELATED EXPLANATION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO THEIR RELATIVES THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X WHO HAD NO CONTACT WITH DISEASE X SHOWS THAT IT MIGHT BE GENETIC AND THEIR RELATIVES MAY BE CARRIERS IN STUDY 2 IT COULD BE EITHER BACTERIUM VIRUS RELATED OR IT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH DIET THE CHICKENS WERE EXPOSED TO BACTERIA AND THEY WERE FED A CERTAIN DIET IN STUDY 3 IT COULD BE ALL 3 OF THE POSSIBILITIES AS WELL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FED A POOR DIET DIDNT HAVE DISEASE X AND LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE CHANCES ARE THEY CONTRACTED THE DISEASE BECAUSE OF THEIR DIET IT MAY ALSO BE GENETIC BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS DONT ALWAYS SHOW UP AND THEY COULD BE CARRIERS ALSO ONLY MEN WERE TESTED THE CHANCES OF IT BEING GENETIC ARE UNLIKELY BUT ITS STILL POSSIBLE AND ONE OF THE STAFF WHO CLEANED THE HOUSE MAY HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND THEREFORE EXPOSED THE PARTICIPANTS TO THE DISEASE THIS IS ALSO PROBABLY UNLIKELY AFTER LOOKING OVER THE 3 STUDIES DIETARY DEFICIENCY SHOWED UP IN ALL 3 AS DID BACTERIUM VIRUS RELATED BUT DIETARY DEFICIENCY SEEMS MOST LIKELY	3194	OUT OF ALL THE EXPERIMENTS DONE DOCTOR 1S STUDY DIDNT REALLY EXPLAIN OR NARROW DOWN ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS THERE COULD BE SO MANY REASONS WHY 80 PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR HOUSE NEXT DOOR COULD BE GETTING THIS DISEASE I FEEL THAT DOCTOR 1S SO CALLED VERY COMPLETE INFORMATION IS JUST VERY BASIC DATA AND YOU CANT CONCLUDE ANY EXACT CAUSE OF THE DISEASE FROM THAT DOCTOR 2 TALKS ABOUT COLLECTING BLOOD BUT NOTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE PATIENTS EFFECTED WITH DISEASE X HAVE BEEN LIVING IN BUT DOCTOR 2S STUDY DOES HELP IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS DISEASE X HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DIET AS HE SAYS THAT WHEN ON THE 88TH DAY THE CHICKEN DEVELOPED RED PATCHES ON ITS LEGS IT WAS PLACED IN A DARK ROOM AND THE BACTERIA CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL DIET WAS STOPPED THE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED HOWEVER OUT OF ALL 3 STUDIES DOCTOR 3S STUDY SEEMED WELL PLANNED AS HE HAD A CONTROL GROUP AND A VARIABLE GROUP AND HE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHICH MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO CAUSE DISEASE X FROM DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE CHOICE OF BACTERIUM VIRUS BEING THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X CAN BE RULED OUT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE VERY CLEAN HOUSE AND WHO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO MEET WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THESE 6 MONTHS OF TIME STILL WERE THE ONLY ONES TO CATCH THE DISEASE X IF IT WAS CAUSED DUE TO WATER WHICH IS ALSO ANOTHER WAY BACTERIUM VIRUSES COULD SPREAD THEN EVEN THE 20 MEN WHO ATE REGULAR DIET SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT BUT THEY DIDNT HENCE FROM HIS STUDY WHICH CONCLUDES THAT 6 OUT OF 11 PEOPLE WHO ATE A POOR DIET GOT DISEASE X I FEEL DIETARY DEFICIENCY TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE	3195	FOR ME DOCTOR 3S STUDY SEEMS MOST ACCURATE CAUSE OF DISEASE X FOR INSTANCE IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY ABOUT GENETIC IT DOESNT GIVE ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHO HAD DISEASE IN THAT FAMILY AND WHO HAD NOT IN FACT IM NOT EVEN SURE WHETHER THE CAUSE OF DISEASE COULD BE CONSIDERED IN GENETIC LEVEL DOCTOR 2S STUDY IS SIMPLY IGNORE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE EXPERIMENT WAS TAKEN WHICH CAN BE ANOTHER CAUSE OF DISEASE X DOCTOR 3S STUDY WAS MORE ACCURATE EXPERIMENT COMPARING WITH OTHER TWO I COULD CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT THE CAUSE OF DISEASE BECAUSE 6 MEN WHO LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE GOT DISEASE AND ITS NOT VIRUS OR BACTERIA CAUSE NEITHER BECAUSE THE MEN WHO WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE DIDNT GET THE DISEASE THEREFORE IT EXPLAINS THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY POOR DIET	3196	I THINK IT IS PROBABLY DUE TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THEY ARE PROBABLY LACKING SOMETHING IN THEIR DIET IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY PEOPLE THAT LIVE NEXT TO EACH OTHER HAVE THE DISEASE SO THEY ARE SHARING SOMETHING SUCH AS A WATER SUPPLY THEY MAY NOT BE GETTING THE NUTRIENTS FROM THAT WATER SUPPLY IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE POOR DIET CAUSES THEM TO GET THE DISEASE AND IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE CHICKENS GET THE DISEASE FROM A BACTERIA BUT I WONDER IF THEY ARE GETTING THE DISEASE FROM THE BACTERIA OR FROM THE BACTERIA DEPLETING A NUTRIENT THEREFORE I THINK IT IS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	3197	BECAUSE THOUGH DOCTOR 3S STUDY SHOWS THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS LINKED WITH THIS DISEASE Y THE PREVIOUS STUDIES OF DOCTOR 1 AND DOCTOR 2 SHOW THAT THOUGHT DIET WAS NOT CHANGED THE PATIENTS WERE CURED WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN IF DIET IS LINKED TO THIS DISEASE IT MIGHT ONLY BE BECAUSE OF MAKING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STRONGER TO FIGHT THE BACTERIUM VIRUS THIS DISEASE Y ALSO SEEMS TO BE INFECTING MANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHICH SHOWS THAT ITS CONTAGIOUS HENCE IT IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE	3198	IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE INDEPENDENT STUDIES DONE BY THREE DIFFERENT DOCTORS RESULT IN THREE DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ON THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE I CAN ELIMINATE DOCTOR 2S STUDY AND SAY THAT IT IS NOT VALID BECAUSE THE EXPERIMENT WAS TESTED ON CHICKENS NOT HUMANS AND CHICKENS MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME REACTIONS TO EATING THE CONTAMINATED CORN I CAN ALSO ELIMINATE DOCTOR 3S STUDY BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS THAT WERE EXPERIMENTED ON DOCTOR 1S STUDY INCLUDES A WHOLE VILLAGE WITH 5514 PERSONS AND 115 CASES OF THE DISEASE I BELIEVE THIS DOCTORS STUDY IS THE MOST VALID SINCE IT CONSTITUTES A GREATER NUMBER OF PERSONS IN THE EXPERIMENT	3199	BASED ON THE DATA FROM ALL THREE DOCTORS I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X IS SOME SORT DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE THIRD STUDY HAS THE MOST INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS THIS CLAIM IN THIS STUDY ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD A BAD DIET CONTRACTED THIS DISEASE WHILE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH A NORMAL DIET DID NOT MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ATE A POOR DIET SHOWED DISEASE X THE FIRST EXPERIMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS DATA IT MAKES SENSE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SIMILAR LIVING CONDITIONS IN THIS CASE POOR DIET WILL SHOW SIMILAR SYMPTOMS ALTHOUGH THIS DATA FROM THE SECOND STUDY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IT IS NOT NECESSARILY INCONSISTENT	3200	I BELIEVE THAT THE DISEASE IS CONTRACTED FROM A BACTERIA THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS STUDIES CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE PEOPLE AND THE CHICKEN CONTRACTED THIS DISEASE FROM A GERM PASSED ON THROUGH BLOOD WASTE CONTAMINATED FOOD THE CHICKEN ETC HOWEVER THE THIRD STUDY SHOWS RESULTS THAT POINT TO A DEFICIENCY IN DIET I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE TWO REASONS FOR THEIR CONTRACTION OF DISEASE X FIRST THE FOOD CAME FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE AND WAS NOT CHECKED FOR CONTAMINATION ONE OF THE MEN MAY HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE FROM THE FOOD AND SPREAD IT TO THE OTHERS ALSO THE LACK OF A GOOD DIET COULD AFFECT THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OF THE MEN AND MAKE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE EVEN IN THE FIRST TWO STUDIES NOT EVERYONE IN CONTACT WITH THE FOOD OR PEOPLE GOT THE DISEASE WHICH MEANS THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT OFF THE DISEASE OR BE IMMUNE TO IT	3201	I DETERMINED THIS BECAUSE DOCTORS TWO AND THREE SEEMED TO COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AND DOCTOR ONE WAS ALSO PRETTY CLOSE IN MY OWN OPINION I SAW THAT THIS WAS TRUE BECAUSE DOCTOR THREES EXPERIMENT WAS PRETTY CLEAR HE SEPARATED IT IM A GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS DISEASE WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY ALMOST ALL THE MEN THAT HAD LESS FOOD HAD GOTTEN SICK WHILE THE CHICKENS FOOD REMAINED THE SAME ONLY 1 OF THE SIX GOT SICK DOCTOR ONE COULD HAVE BEEN IN A POOR PART OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE PEOPLE THERE MAY NOT HAVE HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO FEED THEMSELVES CORRECTLY BUT THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED SO TWO OUT OF THE THREE DOCTORS SEEMED TO ME TO BE LEANING TOWARDS THE SIDE OF THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY	3202	I THINK DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY MOST PEOPLE WHO HAD DISEASE X LIVED AROUND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAD IT BUT ONLY 24 OF THEM LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE AS SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAD IT DIETARY DEFICIENCY COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVING AROUND THE SAME AREA SOMETIMES TEND TO EAT THE SAME TYPES OF FOODS IF IT WAS DUE TO BACTERIUM OR VIRUS THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING WITH THE DISEASED PERSON WOULD PROBABLY EVENTUALLY GET THE DISEASE IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE CHICKEN WHO GOT SICK GOT BETTER WHEN IT WAS FED NON CONTAMINATED CORN IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY SIX OF THE MEN FED AN UNHEALTHY DIET GOT DISEASE X WHILE NONE OF THE MEN FED A HEALTHY DIET GOT THE DISEASE SINCE THE MEN FED THE UNHEALTHY FOOD WERE ALL LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE ALL ELEVEN OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY GET THE DISEASE IF IT WAS DUE TO BACTERIA	3203	TWO OUT OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTS INVOLVED THE DIETARY NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN THE EXPERIMENT CLEARLY BY THE DEFICIENCY IN PROPER DIET THE DISEASE X WAS MORE PRONOUNCE ALSO IN EXPERIMENT 1 IT COULD BE RELATED TO THE FOOD TOO ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT INDICATED THE SAME DIET MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN IN NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS	3204	DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST ACCURATE CAUSE OF DISEASE X DOCTOR 1 STATES THAT 80 OF DISEASE X ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE OR LIVE NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER THESE PEOPLE COULD BE EXCHANGING FOOD WITH ONE ANOTHER OR EATING TOGETHER 7 OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE RELATIVES WITH DISEASE X WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BACTERIA OR GENETIC BUT MOST LIKELY RELATIVES EAT THE SAME FOOD IF RELATIVES HAVE THE SAME EATING HABITS AND HAVE DISEASE X THEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY DOCTOR 2 FOUND THAT ONLY ONE CHICKEN WAS INFECTED WITH DISEASE X THIS CHICKEN WAS NORMAL BEFORE THE CHANGE OF EATING HABIT AND BECAME NORMAL AGAIN AFTER THE CORRECTION OF EATING HABITS DOCTOR 3 MADE THE BEST EXPERIMENT OUT OF ALL THE DOCTORS BY PLACING MAKING MOST OF THE MEN EAT HEALTHY AND A SMALL PART OF THE MEN EAT UNHEALTHY ALTHOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE HEALTHY EATING MEN WAS FULL OF BACTERIA NONE OF THE MEN WERE INFECTED THE 5 OUT OF 6 OF THE MEN WHO ATE UNHEALTHY WERE INFECTED WITH DISEASE X EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT	3205	EVEN THOUGH DISEASE X CAN BE CONTACTED THROUGH MANY WAYS READING THE THREE CASES I BELIEVED THAT THE MOST LIKELY WAYS THAT THIS DISEASE COULD BE CONTACTED IS THROUGH DIETARY DEFICIENCY MEANING THAT THERE IS A LACK OF SOME IMPORTANT NUTRIENT IN FOOD THIS IS IN TRUE IN THE CASE OF THE 2ND AND THIRD DOCTORS STUDY THE 2ND STUDY SHOWS THAT WHEN CHICKENS DIET WAS CHANGED FROM CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL TO CRACKED CORN CHICKEN 5 WAS SICK EVEN THOUGH THE CORNMEAL WAS CONTAMINATED WITH A BACTERIA THAT DONT MEAN THE BACTERIA IS VIRULENT ALL CHICKENS WERE HEALTHY STILL WHEN THEIR DIET WAS CHANGED TO CRACKED CORN AND EVEN THOUGH CRACKED CORN WAS UNCONTAMINATED IT HAD ALL THE NUTRIENTS NEEDED TO PREVENT DISEASES IN THE CASE OF THE THIRD STUDY DISEASE X IS MOST LIKELY TO BE CAUSED BY DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE DISEASE X WAS PRESENT ONLY AMONG PEOPLE THAT ATE POOR DIET BUT ABSENT AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAD A RICH DIET THAT IS OBVIOUS SO IT IS NOT GOT BY VIRUS BECAUSE IT DONT MATTER WHERE THE PEOPLE LIVED IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT OR NOT AND IT CANT BE GENETIC BECAUSE THESE MEN WERE NOT RELATED AT ALL	3206	DISEASE X MUST BE CAUSED BY A DEFICIENCY IN DIET AS THE THIRD STUDY IS THE CLEAREST AND IT STATES THAT THE MEN WHO SHOWED THE DISEASE HAD A POOR DIET BUT LIVED IN CLEAN CONDITIONS THOSE THAT DID NOT SHOW DISEASE X LIVED IN A BACTERIA RIDDEN ENVIRONMENT BUT SOWED NO TRACE OF THE DISEASE	3207	I BELIEVE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE X WAS MOST LIKELY DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE ITS BASED ON EXPERIMENT 3 WHICH WAS THE MOST THOROUGHLY DONE THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVED DIRECT WITH PEOPLE WITH NO BACKGROUND OF HAVING DISEASE X AND ALL WERE PUT ON STRICT DIETS THE MEN THAT WERE EATING HEALTHY ALSO DID NOT STAY CLEAN OR LIVE IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT THE MEN THAT GOT SICK HOWEVER HAD A NON HEALTHY DIET BUT LIVED IN A VERY CLEAN ENVIRONMENT LEADING ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS DISEASE IS BECAUSE OF ONES DIET AND NOT FROM GENETICS OR FROM A VIRUS BECAUSE THESE MEN WHO GOT SICK ALSO DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOME AND THE EXPERIMENT IN RELATING THIS OPINION TO THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS THE PEOPLE WHO EITHER LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE NEXT DOOR OR THAT WERE IN THE SAME FAMILY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THIS DISEASE BECAUSE OF A POOR DIET ALSO OR BECAUSE THEY WERE EATING THE SAME CONTAMINATED FOOD THE CHICKEN THAT GOT SICK ALSO WAS FED JUST PLAIN ROTTEN FOOD AND MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED JUST A POOR DIET IF I DIDNT HAVE TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE I WOULD SAY THE DISEASE IS FOOD RELATED THE DISEASE CAN BE CAUSED BY A BAD DIET OR BY CONTAMINATED FOOD	3208	FIRST STUDY PEOPLE IN CLOSE CONTACT DISEASE WAS PASSED TO THEM WITH DISEASED PEOPLE IE RELATIVES NEIGHBORS GOT THE DISEASE PLUS PEOPLE WITH POSSIBLE WEAKER IMMUNE SYSTEM INFECTIOUS DISEASE SECOND STUDY THAT CHICKEN GOT POSSIBLY SICK BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIAL INFECTION THIS TYPE OF BACTERIA COULD BE MORE HARMFUL THAN THE OTHERS AND POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ITS WEAKER IMMUNE SYSTEM THIRD STUDY CAUSE IN THIS STUDY IS NOT SO CLEAR BUT CAN BE ALSO DUE TO THE INFECTION EVEN THOUGH THE MEN WHO WERE ON THE POOR DIET LIVED IN CLEAN HOUSE AND AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE THEY COULD EASILY GET AN INFECTION BECAUSE OF THEIR WEAKER IMMUNE SYSTEM LESS PROTEINS SUPPOSING THAT THE AGENT COULD HARM YOU ONLY IF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY NORMALLY YOU WOULD MANAGE IT TO KILL IT	3209	I THINK DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE DOCTOR 3 DID A STUDY WITH 11 MEN AND 20 OTHER MEN LEAVING IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND EATING DIFFERENT KIND OF FOOD AND THE 11 MEN THAT DID NOT EAT A MORE HEALTHY FOOD 6 OF THEN GOT SICK AND THE OTHER 20 ME WHO ATE A MORE RICHER FOOD GOT 0 SICK PEOPLE THE SAME THING OCCURRED WITH DOCTOR 2 WHEN HE CHANGE THE DIET OF THE CHICKEN ONE OF THEN ALSO GOT SICK JUST BECAUSE OF THEY WAY THEY CHANGE THE NUTRITION ALSO IN DOCTOR ONE IT SEEM THAT HE TRYING TO SAY THAT IS CAUSE BY A BACTERIA OR VIRUS BUT IT MAY BE ALSO THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE HOLD ATE THE SAME KIND OF FOOD AS WELL AS THE NEIGHBOR THAT IS WHY THEY GOT THE DISEASE	3210	THE PATTERNS OF STUDY 1 APPEAR TO NOT BE GENETIC AS ONLY 7 OF THE 23 PEOPLE WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAD NO EXPOSURE TO DISEASE X HAD RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE OTHERWISE IT WAS NEIGHBORS OR PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR HOME FOR STUDY 2 HE TOOK THE 9 TYPES OF BACTERIA AND ONE OF THE CHICKENS DEVELOPED THE DISEASE WHICH WAS EXPOSED TO THAT ONE TYPE OF BACTERIA TAKEN FROM THE DISEASED PEOPLES BLOOD OR FOOD THE LAST STUDY SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT ONE CAN FIGHT OFF THE DISEASE FROM SETTING IN BY KEEPING ONES IMMUNE SYSTEM IN NICE SHAPE WHICH WAS INDICATED BY THE FACT THAT 20 MEN WERE GIVE AN RICH DIET AND LIVED IN A DIRTY HOME BUT NO ONE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THE OTHER 11 MEN ATE A POOR DIET WHICH WOULDNT HELP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM NO MATTER HOW CLEAN THE HOUSE WAS THEY WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE	3211	FOR STUDIES 2 AND 3 IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS CAUSED B Y A DIETARY IMBALANCE FOR THE FIRST STUDY IT WAS SEEN TO BE BACTERIAL IT COULD HAVE BEEN DIETARY AS WELL BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE SAME FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS TEND TO EAT THE SAME THINGS AND MAY HAVE A DIETARY IMBALANCE	3212	IN BOTH DOCTOR ONE AND DOCTOR TWOS REPORTS THE PRESENCE OF A PARTICULAR BACTERIA IS IMPLIED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND TEST PROVEN THE FIRST ONE ALSO IMPLIES THAT CONTACT IS IMPORTANT FOR PASSING THE DISEASE ALONG THE THIRD TEST PRESENTS A PROBLEM THOUGH IT SAYS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MEN WITH THE POOR DIET WERE LIVING IN PRISTINELY CLEAN CONDITIONS THEY DEVELOPED THE DISEASE IMPLYING THAT POOR DIET IS RESPONSIBLE IN THE SECOND TEST HOWEVER THE CHICKEN WHO CONTRACTED THE DISEASE WAS ON A QUITE EXCELLENT DIET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE POOR DIET WEAKENED THEYRE IMMUNE SYSTEM THUS MAKING THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE	3213	I FEEL THAT THE DISEASE COULD BE THE CAUSE OF MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE FIRST CASE IT MOST LIKELY SEEMS THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY A VIRUS SINCE EVERYONE WHO HAD THE DISEASED LIVED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND HAD CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER ON A DAILY BASIS IN THE SECOND STUDY I BELIEVE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS GENETIC BECAUSE OUT OF ALL THE CHICKENS ONLY ONE WAS SICK WHEN FED THE CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL THE THIRD STUDY SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO BE A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THAT CAUSED THE DISEASE AMONG THE MEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY MAYBE THE DISEASE CAN BE TRIGGERED BY ALL THREE POSSIBILITIES	3214	IN THE FIRST CASE ALMOST ALL OF THE SICK INDIVIDUALS HAS SOME KIND OF CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER INDICATING A TRANSMISSIBLE CAUSE EVEN THOUGH 16 INDIVIDUALS DID NOT HAVE CONTACT MOST OF THEM DID IN THE SECOND CASE THE SICK CHICKEN WAS GIVEN FOOD CONTAMINATED WITH AN AGENT AND IT GOT SICK ALMOST ABSOLUTELY POINTING TO THIS AGENT IT COULD NOT BE DIETARY RELATED SINCE ALL THE CHICKENS WERE GIVEN THE SAME KINDS OF FOOD AND ONLY THE CONTAMINATING AGENT WAS CHANGED THE THIRD CASE POSES A PROBLEM FOR THE BACTERIAL CAUSE IT SEEMS TO POINT TO A DIETARY PROBLEM HOWEVER ONE COULD SAY THAT THESE MEN WERE LIVING TOGETHER AND ONE OF THE MEN COULD HAVE COME INTO THE FACILITY CARRYING THE DISEASE AND INFECTED THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS IF EACH MAN IN THE GROUP HAD BEEN ISOLATED IT WOULD BE CLEARER THAT THE DISEASE WAS NOT TRANSMITTED AND WAS MORE LIKELY DUE TO DIET TAKING ALL OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT I THINK THAT THE CAUSE IS BACTERIAL VIRAL	3215	I THOUGHT THAT THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE CAME FROM EXPERIMENT 2 AND 3 IN THESE EXPERIMENTS I THOUGHT THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS DIETARY BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR COMMON THREAD THESE EXPERIMENT WAS MORE CONTROLLED AND ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IF CHICKENS AND THE MEN HAD NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF THE DISEASE THE FIRST EXPERIMENT WAS JUST A SURVEY AND REALLY DIDNT HELP ME MUCH IN MY DECISION BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING ABOUT SMALL TOWNS I THINK THAT THE DIET OF THE PEOPLE THERE WOULD PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SO THE FACT WHETHER THEY HAD NEIGHBORS WITH THE DISEASE WOULDNT BE SURPRISING	3216	FIRST OF ALL THE COMMON POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE THAT I SELECTED BETWEEN THE LAST TWO STUDIES WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE FIRST STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE THAT VARIABLE IN ITS STUDY HOWEVER IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT A DIETARY DEFICIENCY COULD HAVE CAUSED THE DISEASE IN THE FIRST STUDY I THINK THAT IT IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE BECAUSE IN THE THIRD STUDY GENETIC AND BACTERIAL VIRAL VARIABLES WERE CONTROLLED THUS BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE IS DIETARY	3217	TWO OF THE STUDIES APPEAR TO STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT A BACTERIA IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE STUDY 1 THE INVESTIGATIONS DONE IN THIS EXPERIMENT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN PROXIMITY TO INFECTED PERSONS AND FREQUENCY OF DISEASE X THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT WAS INFECTED HOWEVER IS SMALL APPROX 1 50 THIS FACT INDICATES THAT THERE MOST LIKELY MUST BE PROLONGED OR REPEATED EXPOSURE TO THE DISEASE IN ORDER FOR INFECTION TO OCCUR WHICH SUPPORTS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PROXIMITY AND INFECTION STUDY 2 THIS STUDY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT A BACTERIA IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CHICKEN MATCHED THOSE FOUND IN HUMANS WHEN EXPOSED TO A PARTICULAR BACTERIAL SAMPLE FROM AN INFECTED INDIVIDUAL HOWEVER SOME ASPECTS OF THIS STUDY APPEAR TO CONTRADICT THE CONCLUSIONS OF STUDY 1 FOR INSTANCE IF THE CHICKENS WERE KEPT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR 38 DAYS OTHER CHICKENS SHOULD HAVE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE THAT WAS MANIFESTING ITSELF IN THE INFECTED CHICKEN THERE IS NO MENTION OF THIS OCCURRING BUT THERE IS ALSO NO MENTION OF HOW OR WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE KEPT IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER ONE STUDY COULD BE INTERPRETED SUCH THAT A BACTERIA WITH COULD ALSO BE PLAYING A ROLE STUDY 3 THIS STUDY IS PRIMARILY EXAMINING DIET IN RELATION TO DISEASE X THE CONCLUSIONS ONE CAN DRAW FROM THIS STUDY SEEM TO INDICATE THAT DIET MAY BE INVOLVED SOMEHOW WITH DISEASE X HOWEVER WHEN EXAMINED IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER TWO STUDIES ONE COULD SPECULATE THAT A POOR DIET COULD MAKE ONE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE AND THEREFORE ONLY BRIEF CONTACT WITH THE INFECTIOUS AGENT IS NEEDED FOR CONTRACTION THIS COULD EXPLAIN WHY THE MEN ON THE GOOD DIET DID NOT CONTRACT THE DISEASE WHILE SOME OF THOSE ON THE POOR DIET DID ADDITIONALLY THE FACT THAT STUDY 2 INDICATES THAT THE BACTERIA COULD SPREAD VIA FOOD SUPPORTS THIS INTERPRETATION OF STUDY 3	3218	THE DISEASE IS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS FOR SEVERAL REASONS 1 STUDY 1 SHOWS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN PROXIMITY TO INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND THE FREQUENCY OF INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT CONTACT BETWEEN THE INFECTED AND UNINFECTED IS A PRIMARY MEANS OF SPREADING THE DISEASE IE 80 OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WERE EITHER LIVING WITH OR CLOSE TO SOMEONE WHO HAD DISEASE X 2 STUDY 2 DIRECTLY INVESTIGATES THE BACTERIAL CONTENT OF THE BLOOD OF INFECTED PEOPLE CHICKENS AND OTHER BIRDS ARE KNOWN TO BE PRIME CARRIERS FOR VIRAL AND BACTERIAL DISEASES THAT AFFECT HUMANS AND OFTEN EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS OF THESE DISEASES AS WELL BECAUSE OF THIS THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY THIS STUDY WITH THE CHICKENS CAN BE CLOSELY LINKED TO HUMANS AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO CORRELATE THIS DATA VERY CLOSELY TO HUMAN SYMPTOMS THIS STUDY THEREFORE SUGGESTS THAT THE ILLNESS IN THE CHICKEN IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BACTERIUM ISOLATED FROM THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS BLOOD 3 STUDY 3 SUGGESTS THAT THE DIET OF AN INDIVIDUAL IS SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRACTING THE ILLNESS HOWEVER THIS STUDY CAN BE LOOKED AT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST STUDY WHICH SHOWS EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE CONTRACTING THE ILLNESS WITHOUT KNOWN CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED INDIVIDUAL IN WHICH CASE WE CAN SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONTRACT THE ILLNESS WITHOUT REPEATED CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED INDIVIDUAL THE POOR DIET MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A WEAKENED BODILY AND IMMUNE SYSTEM STATE WHICH CAUSED THE MEN ON THE POOR DIET TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION AND THEREFORE CONTRACT THE DISEASE VIA A TRANSMISSION METHOD THAT IS USUALLY NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS FAR AS THE BACTERIUM VIRUS IS CONCERNED	3219	BECAUSE THE STUDY 1 WAS MADE IN 1912 AND 1913 I AM NOT SURE OF HOW THEY MEASURED A GENETIC FACTOR ALSO IT WAS MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE BEARING THE DISEASE OFTEN DIED AND I ALSO WONDER IF THEY DIED AT EARLY AGES BEFORE THE CHANCES OF REPRODUCING I CANNOT IGNORE A GENETIC FACTOR BY THE STUDY 2 EXPLORES THE PROBABILITY OF A BACTERIUM VIRUS CAUSING DISEASE AND IT PROVES THAT BACTERIUM TYPE CAUSES IT BECAUSE THE FOOD PROVIDED TO THE CHICKENS WAS THE SAME AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THE BACTERIA WE MAY THINK THAT FOOD IS NOT AN ISSUE BECAUSE CHICKEN 5 DID NOT REPRODUCE WE CANNOT IGNORE A GENETIC FACTOR TOO EXPERIMENT 3 IS TRYING TO PROVE THAT THE FACTOR WAS A POOR DIET BUT THE FACT THAT THE HOUSE WAS CLEAN DOES NOT TELL ME THAT THERE WAS NO BACTERIA ALSO I DONT BELIEVED THAT AN EXAMINATION OF THREE MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH TO DETERMINE THAT THEY DIDNT PREVIOUSLY HAD THE DISEASE IF ONLY ONE OF THEM HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD THE DISEASE WITHOUT KNOWING IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF THE SICKNESS REAPPEARED UNDER POOR DIET CONDITIONS AND THAT ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THAT HOUSE GOT IT	3220	STUDY 1 DID NOT SHOW A RELIABLE RESULT IT COULD BE ANYTHING RELATED INDIVIDUALS GOT SICK SO IT COULD BE DUE TO GENETIC INDIVIDUALS WITH CLOSE CONTACT BECAME SICK SO IT COULD BE DUE TO VIRUS BACTERIA THEN AGAIN ALL THE PEOPLE LIVED IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WHERE POOR DIET COULD BE A FACTOR STUDY 2 SHOWS A GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY POOR DIET B C ONCE THE SICK CHICKEN WAS FED NON CONTAMINATED RICH DIET THEY GOT BETTER STUDY 3 IS THE MOST RELIABLE ONE IT SHOWED CLEARLY THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY POOR DIET ONLY WITH RICH DIET EVEN WITH CLOSE CONTACT PEOPLE WERE OK AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOT RELATED SO IT CANT BE GENETIC OR VIRUS BACTERIAL STUDY 3 WAS THE MOST RELIABLE ONE AND STUDY 1 WAS THE LEAST THEN THE RESULTS OF STUDY 2 SHOWS SUPPORTS THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY POOR DIET SO I WILL GO WITH THOSE TWO STUDIES AND IGNORE THE UNRELIABLE ONE	3221	I THINK THE STUDIES ARE INCOMPLETE	3222	DR 2 SHOWED STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE BACTERIA IN CHICKENS FOOD CAUSED THEM TO GET SICK BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE DR 1 SHOWED THAT THOSE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE DISEASE HAD FAIRLY HIGH SICKNESS RATES ALTHOUGH GIVEN THAT THE STUDY WAS IN RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA IT COULD BE GENETIC INBREEDING AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO ADDRESS DIET THAT ALSO MAY BE A PROBLEM IN THE RURAL AREA 3 SHOWED THAT IT PROBABLY WASNT COMMUNICABLE BACTERIAL VIRAL SINCE NO ONE THAT HAD OUTSIDE CONTACT AND POOR SANITATION GOT SICK THE EVIDENCE HERE WAS THAT THE POOR DIET HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT ABOUT HALF OF THOSE GOT SICK PROBABLY HERE WAS A COMBINATION OF DIET AND GENES IN THE END I THINK THAT THERE IS A COMBINATION OF DIETARY DEFICIENCY AND GENETIC DISPOSITION	3223	I BELIEVE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS MOST LIKELY THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS OF STUDIES IN STUDY 1 THERE IS NO DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE INFECTED NON INFECTED PEOPLE ARE EATING THIS STUDY LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE THAT PROXIMITY TO AN INFECTED PERSON IS THE WAY THE DISEASE IS SPREAD HOWEVER SINCE IT DID NOT ADDRESS DIETARY ISSUES IT DOES NOT RULE THIS OUT AS THE ROOT CAUSE ALSO THERE IS OFTEN A SOCIOECONOMIC PATTERN TO DIET EG POOR PEOPLE EAT LESS MEAT OR FRESH VEGETABLES AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE STUDIES 2 AND 3 FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON DIETARY ISSUES IN STUDY 2 THE ONE CHICKEN THAT SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X RECOVERED ONCE A HEALTHY DIET WAS RESTORED IN STUDY 3 ONLY MEN EATING A POOR DIET SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X ALSO THIS STUDY WOULD ARGUE AGAINST BACTERIA VIRUS BEING THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X SINCE ALL OF THE MALNOURISHED MEN LIVED TOGETHER BUT THEY DID NOT ALL SHOW THE SYMPTOMS IT IS HARD TO COMMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS A GENETIC CAUSE SINCE NONE OF THE STUDIES ADDRESSED THIS POSSIBILITY	3224	FIRST I COUNTED OUT GENETICS AS BEING THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE BASED MOSTLY ON THE FIRST STUDY WHICH STATED THAT 64 OF THE 115 AFFECTED PEOPLE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO OTHER AFFECTED PEOPLE SINCE THIS IS A LARGE PERCENTAGE LARGER THAN THE PERCENT OF DISEASED PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE AS THOSE WITH THE DISEASE WHICH WOULD IMPLY RELATIVISM AND THOSE ALSO HAVING AFFECTED RELATIVES IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT BACTERIA VIRUS OR DIETARY DEFICIENCY COULD BE THE CAUSE MOVING ON TO STUDY 2 I FIRST SUSPECTED A BACTERIAL CAUSE HOWEVER AFTER READING STUDY 3 I LOOKED BACK ON IT AND DECIDED THAT MAYBE THE BACTERIA IN THE CORNMEAL GIVEN TO THE DISEASED CHICKEN DESTROYED SOME NUTRIENT IN THE CORNMEAL THAT WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE CHICKENS DIET WHICH WOULD POINT TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY FINALLY THE THIRD STUDY SHOWED THAT ALL THE MEN WHO EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED THE DISEASE ATE A POOR DIET OF MOSTLY CARBOHYDRATES BUT LIVED IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER MEN WHO NEVER DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS BUT ATE A BALANCED DIET AND LIVED MUCH LESS SANITARY CONDITIONS MY PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE DISEASE IS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY	4225	IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY 2 OF PEOPLE IN CAROLINA COUNTY HAD DISEASE X 80 OF WHICH LIVED WITH OR NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER LIVING WITH OR NEXT DOOR TO SOMEONE COULD MEAN THAT YOU ARE IN THE SAME ECONOMIC SITUATION AS THEY ARE AND MAY EAT THE SAME DIET BASED ON THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU BOTH IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE DISEASE IS FOUND IN FOOD CONTAMINATED WITH DISEASED BLOOD THE BACTERIA FROM THE BLOOD COULD HAVE ABSORBED A MAJOR NUTRIENT NEEDED BY CHICKEN 5 TO STAY HEALTHY GENETIC DISEASES CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THIS WAY ONLY THOUGH PROCREATION BUT CHICKEN 5 MAY HAVE HAD A GENETIC WEAKNESS TO THE LACK OF SOME NUTRIENT MORE SO THAN THE OTHER CHICKENS SO THE POOR DIET AFFECTED HER MORE DOCTOR 3S STUDY SUGGESTS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY AS CAUSE FOR DISEASE X AS MORE THAN 50 OF SUBJECTS FED THE DEFICIENT DIET DISPLAYED DISEASE X WHILE NO ONE ON A NORMAL DIET DISPLAYED THE DISEASE THIS STUDY WAS NOT VERY COMPELLING AS THE SAMPLE OF THE POPULATION WAS POOR ALL MEN A CERTAIN AGE AND NOT VERY MANY OF THEM	4226	I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF DISEASE X IS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY WHILE THE DATA FROM DOCTOR 2 AT FIRST GLANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE BACTERIA ARE PRIMARY CAUSAL FACTORS IT MAY BE THAT THEY ARE ONLY SECONDARILY INVOLVED DOCTOR 3S STUDY CLEARLY SHOWS A CORRELATION BETWEEN DIET AND THE DISEASE THE FIRST DOCTORS DATA IS NOT VERY INFORMATIVE AND DOES NOT LEAD TO A FIRM CONCLUSION OF THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X THE SECOND DOCTORS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE CAUSE OF A CHICKENS ILLNESS WAS BACTERIAL WHAT IS ALSO STATED IS THAT THE CHICKEN RECOVERED UPON BEING FED NON INFECTED GRAIN THIS MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THE BACTERIA 5 WAS CHANGING THE NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THE GRAIN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BACTERIUM 5 WAS METABOLIZING THE GRAIN RENDERING SOME ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT INTO SOMETHING EITHER UNUSABLE OR MAKING THAT NUTRIENT SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT I WOULD WANT TO PERFORM A STUDY ON BACTERIAS EFFECT ON CORN MEALS NUTRITIONAL CONTENT TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS ACTING UPON PROTEIN OR THE VITAMINS WITHIN THE SEED IF I FOUND NO CHANGE IN UNTAINTED GRAIN AS OPPOSED TO THE INFECTED I WOULD CONCLUDE THAT THE BACTERIA MAY BE A PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE ILLNESS I AM ASSUMING THAT THE DOCTORS STUDIES WERE PERFORMED AS DESCRIBED AND THAT ALL COLLECTED DATA WERE VALID	4227	I BELIEVE THAT THE STUDIES PROVIDED DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT EVIDENCE OR SUBJECTS IN THEM TO CONCLUDE A DIFFERENT CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE HOWEVER IF I HAD TO SPECULATE ON A CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IT MAY BE CAUSED DUE TO A DEFICIENT DIET THE FIRST STUDY LOOKED AT DISEASED PEOPLES CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAVE THE DISEASE THIS CONCLUDED THAT OUT OF 115 PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X ONLY 16 OF THEM DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAVE DISEASE X THIS STUDY MAY SHOW THAT THE DISEASE IS A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS SINCE IT COULD BE SEEN AS SOMEHOW SPREADING FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER POOR SANITATION MAY BE A REASON HOWEVER IN THE THIRD STUDY THE 6 MEN WHO SHOWED SIGNS OF DISEASE X ARE NOT ALLOWED CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE SO THAT MAY POSSIBLY BE RULED OUT THIS FIRST STUDY COULD SHOW THAT DISEASE X COULD BE DUE TO A DEFICIENT DIET SINCE PEOPLE IN THE SAME SMALL AREA WITH SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ALL HAVE DEFICIENT DIET DUE TO LACK OF FOOD ETC STUDY THREE SEEMS TO BE THE STRONGEST STUDY OUT OF THE THREE IT SHOWED THAT 6 MEN OUT OF 11 PROBABLY CONTRACTED DISEASE X FROM A POOR DIET HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SMALL NUMBER AND THAT THE EXPERIMENT SHOULD HAVE HAD A GREATER NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENT AND IF POSSIBLE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN EACH SIDE OF THE EXPERIMENT THIS STUDY DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE MAN CONTRACTED DISEASE X BY POOR DIET THAN SPREAD IT TO THE OTHER MEN HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT DISEASE X IS A BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS CAN NOT BE RULED OUT SINCE IN STUDY TWO THE EXPERIMENTER FOUND THAT A CHICKEN WHO WAS FED A TYPE OF BACTERIA FROM THE BLOOD OF AN INFECTED PERSON CONTRACTED THE DISEASE THE INTERESTING FINDING IN THIS EXPERIMENT IS HOWEVER THAT ONLY ONE CHICKEN GOT SICK IN CONCLUSION I DO NOT BELIEVE I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT I KNOW HOW DISEASE X IS CONTRACTED	4228	THE THIRD STUDY WAS THE MOST CONCLUSIVE THE FIRST STUDY SUGGESTS A BACTERIOLOGICAL CAUSE BUT IT CONTAINED SEVERAL ERRORS WHICH MAKES ONE SKEPTICAL OF THE VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS FIRST THEY CONFUSE THE DATES IS IT 1912 OR 1942 THAT THE TEST WAS TAKEN SECOND THE NUMBERS DONT ADD UP COMBINING ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE AND NEXT DOOR TO SOMEONE ELSE WITH DISEASE X WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DIDNT ADDS UP TO 103 NOT 115 THE SECOND STUDY WAS INCONCLUSIVE WITH ONLY ONE IN SIX CHICKENS GETTING SICK FROM A BACTERIOLOGICAL CAUSE IN ADDITION THE SYMPTOMS ARE GENERAL ENOUGH THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THE CHICKEN BECAME SICK FROM ANOTHER CAUSE THE THIRD STUDY SEEMED TO BE THE MOST VALID THERE WAS A LARGER SAMPLE AND A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO WERE EXPOSED TO THE BAD DIET GOT THE DISEASE THEREFORE A DIETARY CAUSE IS THE MOST LIKELY	4229	I THINK THAT DISEASE X IS CONTRACTED THROUGH A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THAT IS A COMMON THREAD THROUGH ALL THREE OF THE CASE STUDIES IN CASE ONE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE CAUSE IS A CONTAGIOUS BACTERIA BECAUSE SO FEW IN THE TOWN HAVE THE DISEASE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE WOULD BE CONTAINED IN ONE AREA IF BACTERIA WAS THE CAUSE GENETICS IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE SPREAD WITHIN NEIGHBORS THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE WHOLE FAMILIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SIMILAR DIETS EXPLAINING THE SPREAD WITHIN FAMILIES ALSO THOSE IN POORER SECTIONS OF THE TOWN ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE THE FINANCES TO PROVIDE A HEALTHY DIET EXPLAINING THE REASON FOR NEIGHBORS TO BE INFECTED IN STUDY 2 ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CHANCE THAT BACTERIA 5 THAT THE DOCTOR MADE IS THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS ALSO A LIKELY CHANCE THE DIET OF CORNMEAL POLISHED RICE AND CRACKED CORN MAY NOT BE A HEALTHY DIET FOR CHICKENS CAUSING THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY NEEDED TO SPREAD THE DISEASE I DO NOT KNOW ALSO THIS THEORY IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THE CHICKENS GOT WELL WHEN THEIR DIET CHANGED CASE 3 IS WHAT MADE ME DECIDE THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE ALTHOUGH BACTERIA IS A POSSIBILITY BECAUSE THE MEN LIVED IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS DOCTOR 3 HAD THE CHANCE TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE MEN BEFORE THEY CHANGED THEIR DIET IF BACTERIA OR GENETICS WERE THE CAUSE IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THE 11 MEN WOULD HAVE SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF DISEASE WITHIN THE 3 MONTHS OBSERVED ALSO IT IS LIKELY THAT AT LEAST 1 OF THE 20 HEALTHY DIETERS WOULD HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE HAD IT BEEN CONTRACTED THROUGH BACTERIA	4230	AFTER THE FIRST EXPERIMENT I BELIEVED A BACTERIUM WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISEASE X MANY OF THE INFECTED PERSONS LIVED NEAR EACH OTHER BUT THIS FACT DID NOT PARTICULARLY RULE OUT ANY OF THE THREE POSSIBILITIES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INFECTED WITH THE DISEASE WHO HAD AN INFECTED PERSON LIVING NEXT DOOR 56 GAVE ME A GOOD INDICATOR THAT THIS WAS NOT A GENETIC DISEASE IF IT WAS MORE OF THE CASES WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN A HOUSE WITH AN INFECTED PERSON THIS FACT THAT THE DISEASE WAS NOT NECESSARILY STAY IN FAMILIES BUT WAS PRESENT IN THE AREA AROUND INFECTED CASES LEAD ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS EITHER A GERM MOVING FROM PERSON TO PERSON OR A DEFICIENCY CAUSED BY THE POOR DIETS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN PARTICULAR AREAS PEOPLE LIVING IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD PROPER FOOD AT FIRST I HYPOTHESIZED THAT BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS WAS PROBABLY THE CAUSE THE SECOND EXPERIMENT CAUSED ONLY ONE OF NINE CHICKENS TO BECOME INFECTED THIS CAUSED ME TO BECOME SKEPTICAL ABOUT DISEASE X BEING A BACTERIA PERHAPS THAT CHICKEN HAD DIFFICULTY PROCESSING SOMETHING IN HIS DIET WHICH CAUSED A DEFICIENCY PERHAPS ALSO THE BACTERIA HAD ANOTHER SIMILAR DISEASE THREE GAVE ASTONISHING RESULTS ONE GROUP OF MEN HAD A MINIMAL CHANCE OF CATCHING THE DISEASE IF IT WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIA AND A GOOD CHANCE OF CATCHING THE DISEASE IF IT WAS CAUSED BY A DEFICIENCY 6 OUT OF 11 PEOPLE FROM THIS GROUP HAD THE DISEASE THE OTHER GROUP HAD A MINIMAL CHANCE OF CATCHING THE DISEASE IF IT WAS CAUSED BY DEFICIENCY AND A GOOD CHANCE IF IT WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIA 0 OUT OF 20 MEN CAUGHT DISEASE X THIS LOPSIDED DATA HAD ME CONCLUDE THAT DEFICIENCY PROBABLY IS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X	4231	STUDY 3 SEEMED TO SPECIFICALLY TEST DIET AS A CAUSE THE RESULTS WERE ALSO MORE CONCLUSIVE THAN THOSE FOR STUDY 2 IN MY OPINION WHILE STUDY 2 SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT BACTERIA 5 WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISEASE IT DID NOT GIVE ME ENOUGH INFORMATION TO RULE OUT OTHER OPTIONS SPECIFICALLY WERE THE CHICKENS KEPT NEAR EACH OTHER IF SO THEN WHY WERE MORE CHICKENS NOT AFFECTED BY CONTACT WITH CHICKEN 5 ALSO I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH RICE THEY ATE IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTAMINATED CORNMEAL THE STUDY DID NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ENOUGH INFO TO MAKE MY DECISION STUDY 3 SEEMED TO RELATE THE DISEASE CLEARLY TO DIET STUDY ONE INDICATED THAT THE DISEASE MIGHT BE PASSED BY CONTACT DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE DISEASED PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER I ALSO CONTEMPLATED A GENETIC DISORDER BY REASONING THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE RELATED AND HAD LIVED IN THE SAME COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME HOWEVER WHEN CONSIDERING ALL THE INFORMATION TOGETHER IT SEEMED REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT IF THE DISEASED PEOPLE ALL LIVED NEAR EACH OTHER THEN THEY MIGHT BE LIVING THE SAME LIFESTYLE AND EATING THE SAME FOOD THIS EXPLANATION SUPPORTED THE FINDINGS OF 2 OF THE STUDIES THATS WHAT I BASED MY DECISION ON	4232	THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE IF YOU EXAMINE THE LIFESTYLE OF PEOPLE IN THE EARLY 1900S SANITARY ISSUES AND DIETARY ISSUES WERE PROMINENT THIS COULD LEAD TO A BACTERIA VIRUS CAUSING DISEASE OR DIETARY DEFICIENCY COULD ALSO BE A FACTOR MANY PEOPLE WERE POOR DURING THIS TIME AND NUTRITION WAS NOT A CONCERN OR WELL KNOWN FIELD OF STUDY I IMMEDIATELY DISREGARDED GENETICS AS A FACTOR BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF AFFECTED PEOPLE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY UNLIKELY IN DOCTOR STUDY 1 THE RESULTS ARE INCONCLUSIVE TO VIRAL OR DIETARY MEANS BECAUSE THE STUDY WAS VERY BROAD IN NATURE GENETICS COULD EVEN BE A QUESTION HERE KNOWING THAT IN THE EARLY 1900S MANY PEOPLE STAYED CLOSE TO HOME AND IT WAS LIKELY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DISEASED WERE RELATED EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE DOCTOR STUDY 2 WAS MORE INVESTIGATIVE WHEN ONE CHICKEN GREW ILL BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINATED FEED THIS PROVED THAT THE CAUSE WAS NOT GENETICS HOWEVER IT DID NOT CONCLUDE IF THE DISEASE WAS VIRAL OR DIETARY RELATED I DID LEAN TOWARDS DIETARY AT THIS POINT BECAUSE ONLY ONE CHICKEN BECAME SICK AND IT TOOK AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE CHICKENS SYMPTOMS TO SHOW AND THEN DEVELOP DOCTOR STUDY 3 WAS CONCLUSIVE IN THE CAUSE AS DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THE STUDY WAS ISOLATED THEREFORE ELIMINATING ALL OTHER FACTORS THE VIRAL DEBATE ENDED WHEN THE DOCTOR SCREENED THE VOLUNTEERS FOR A PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISEASE EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE WITH THE POOR DIET WAS KEPT CLEAN THERE WERE STILL SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WHEN MORE THAN HALF OF THE VOLUNTEERS BECAME SICK IN THE HOUSE WITH THE GOOD DIET NO ONE BECAME SICK EVEN THOUGH THE CLEANLINESS WAS NOT MAINTAINED IN LOOKING AT EACH STUDY WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS ONE CAN DEDUCE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE TO BE DIETARY RELATED	4233	I BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DOCTORS REPORTS SHOWED A POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE SOMETHING DIETARY THE FIRST REPORT MAY SEEM OUTLANDISH THAT IT COULD BE A CAUSE BUT SINCE MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVED NEAR OR WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY MOST LIKELY COULD BE EATING OR NOT EATING THE PROPER NUTRIENTS IN THE SECOND STUDY THERE WAS ONLY 1 OUT OF THE 9 CHICKENS WHO DEVELOPED DISEASE X THE INTERESTING PART IS THAT IT COULD BE DUE TO BACTERIA AND I HAVE QUESTIONED THAT POSSIBILITY HOWEVER THE CHICKENS DIET WAS ALSO CHANGED FOR THE TIME THAT THE DIET WAS CHANGED THE CHICKEN THAT DID DEVELOP DISEASE X COULD HAVE BEEN LACKING NUTRIENTS THAT HE SHE NEEDED I ALSO THOUGHT THAT IF IT WAS SOMETHING BACTERIUM VIRAL THEN MORE CHICKENS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED THE THIRD STUDY WAS REALLY WHAT MADE ME BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DIET THAT WAS CAUSING THESE MEN TO BECOME SICK THEY WERE NOT EATING PROPERLY THEY WERE NOT GETTING ENOUGH PROTEIN WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN A CAUSE OF THEIR ILLNESS I DID THINK POSSIBLY A BACTERIA COULD ALSO BE THE CAUSE SINCE THEY ARE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE HOWEVER EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN DUE TO THE POOR DIET ONE COULD HAVE BECOME SICK AND LESSENED THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEN PASSED IT ON TO OTHER PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE THE HOUSE WAS ALSO KEPT CLEAN WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE MEN FROM GETTING THE DISEASE IF IT WAS THROUGH BACTERIA I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE DIET MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO DO WITH DISEASE X	4234	I THINK THAT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED THROUGH A DIETARY DEFICIENCY FOR A FEW REASONS IN THE DATA FROM THE FIRST DOCTOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY DISEASE X LIVED IN THE SAME VICINITY OF EACH OTHER EITHER NEXT DOOR OR IN THE SAME HOUSE A FEW NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAD RELATIVES THAT HAD THE DISEASE AND ANOTHER FEW HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANYONE AFFECTED PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SAME AREA TEND TO HAVE SIMILAR INCOMES LIVING IN EITHER GOOD OR POOR QUALITIES AND EITHER BEING ABLE TO AFFORD GOOD FOOD OR MOT SO GOOD FOOD NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD EAT THE SAME DIET FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THE AFFECTED FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT EAT SIMILARLY IN THE SECOND DOCTORS DATA ONE CHICKEN OUT OF NINE BECAME SICK BEING FED BACTERIA RIDDEN CORNMEAL PERHAPS THAT CHICKEN WAS LACKING SOMETHING IN ITS DIET THAT MADE IT SICK LIKE EATING CORNMEAL WASNT SUFFICIENT FOR IT AND IN THE THIRD DOCTORS DATA MEN LIVING IN UNCLEANLY CONDITIONS WITH A GOOD DIET WERE ALRIGHT AND ABOUT HALF OF THE MEN WHO LIVED IN CLEANLY CONDITIONS BUT ATE POOR DIETS WERE AFFECTED BY DISEASE X SO I THINK THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE PERSON AND THE DIET	4235	I THINK ITS CAUSED FROM A LACK OF SOMETHING IN THE DIET IN THE FIRST STUDY THERE WERE SIX VILLAGES INVOLVED BUT THE STUDY DOESNT MENTION IF THE POPULATION OF SICK PEOPLE CAME FROM A PARTICULAR AREA THE FACT THAT THE SICKNESS WAS CONTAINED WITHIN A GROUP OF PEOPLE KNOWING OR IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT COULD BE AN AREA THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR PROPER FOOD OR LACK OF KNOWING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR A HEALTHY DIET THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES CULTURE MAY NOT INCORPORATE CERTAIN FOODS WHICH MAY LEAD TO A HEALTHY LIFE IN THE THIRD CASE IT AGAIN POINTS TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE LACKING SOMETHING IN THE DIET AT ONE POINT THEY DID HAVE YOUR VARIOUS FOOD AND THEN IT WAS DRASTICALLY REDUCE TO MOSTLY CARBOS THIS CAUSED A DEFICIENCY OF CERTAIN VITAMINS IN THE SECOND STUDY I THINK THE STUDY WAS TO GENERAL I DID NOT FEEL THAT HE USED ENOUGH TOOLS IN MEASURING CORNMEAL WITH BACTERIA ONLY ONE CHICKENS GOT SICK MAYBE THIS WAS JUST LUCK ONE GOT SICK I THINK THE STUDY SHOULD HAVE USED ANIMALS PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AS THOSE WHO WERE SICK	4236	FROM STUDY 1 IT DOESNT APPEAR THAT THE DISEASE IS GENETICALLY LINKED IF IT WERE THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH DISEASE X WHO HAD SOMEONE ELSE WITH THE DISEASE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE ALSO OF THE 23 PEOPLE WITH NO ONE ELSE WITH THE DISEASE LIVING EITHER NEXT DOOR OR IN THE SAME HOUSE THERE WERE MORE THAT HAD NO APPARENT CONTACT WITH RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE THAN HAD RELATIVES WITH THE DISEASE THIS MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT THE DISEASE IS PASSED ON GENETICALLY FROM STUDY 3 NONE OF THE 20 INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND LIVED IN A DIRTY HOUSE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE HOWEVER SOME OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE THIS WOULD MAKE IT UNLIKELY THAT THE DISEASE WAS PASSED THROUGH A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS IF IT WERE THERE WOULD BE LESS PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN A SANITARY ENVIRONMENT WITH NO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD POTENTIALLY INFECT THEM WITH THE DISEASE WOULD HAVE LOWER INSTANCES OF THE DISEASE THIS WAS NOT THE CASE SO THAT NARROWS THE CAUSE TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY AND WE CAN LOOK TO STUDY 2 TO CONFIRM IN STUDY NUMBER 2 ONLY ONE OF THE 9 STRAINS OF BACTERIA FED TO THE CHICKENS CAUSED SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY IMPLY THAT THE DISEASE IS PASSED ON THROUGH A BACTERIUM HOWEVER IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT THE BACTERIUM WILL NOT INFECT SOMEONE WITH THE DISEASE ON ITS OWN BUT MAY CAUSE A LOSS OF VITAMINS OR MINERALS IN FOOD SUCH AS THE CORN WHEN IT GROWS ON IT THUS WHEN THE CORN CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA 5 WAS FED TO THE CHICKEN IT WAS NOT THE BACTERIA ITSELF THAT MADE IT SICK BUT THE LACK OF NUTRIENTS THAT THE BACTERIA CAUSED IN THE CORN THIS WOULD CORROBORATE WITH THE DATA IN STUDY 3	4237	THE CAUSE OF DISEASE X IS DUE TO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY REASON THE FIRST REASON IS REALLY JUST A DISCREDITING OF DOCTOR 2S STUDY CHICKEN 5 MAY HAVE GOTTEN SICK BECAUSE THE BACTERIA THAT IT WAS FED MIGHT HAVE USED THE PARTICULAR NUTRIENT IN ITS OWN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE NEGATED ITS BENEFICIARY THE USE OF THAT NUTRIENT ALSO PEOPLE LIVING NEXT TO EACH OTHER MIGHT HAVE THE SAME INCOME AND THEREFORE BUY THE SAME TYPE OF FOOD A LOW INCOME AREA WOULD RESULT IN LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVING BAD DIETS FINALLY SOME PEOPLE MAY BE MORE PRONE TO GETTING A DISEASE THAN OTHERS AND IF DOCTOR 3 HAD JUST CONTINUED HIS EXPERIMENT LONGER ALL OF THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD THE DISEASE	4238	IN THE DOCTOR 1S STUDY IT SAID THAT OF THE 115 PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X 16 OF THE PEOPLE HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANYONE WHO HAD DISEASE X IF THEY HAD NO CONTACT THEN THE DISEASE COULD NOT BE A BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS DISEASE X COULD ALSO NOT BE GENETIC BECAUSE NEIGHBORS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGES WERE ALSO GETTING SICK IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY IT SAID THAT HE TOOK BLOOD FROM PATIENTS WITH DISEASE X AND GREW THE BACTERIA PUT IT ON CORNMEAL AND FED IT TO THE CHICKENS I MEAN THAT SOUNDS GOOD BUT THE BACTERIA THAT WAS GROWN COULD BE ANY BACTERIA THE CHICKENS WERE ALL EATING A POOR DIET OF CORNMEAL SO THAT LEADS ME TO THINK THAT IT COULD HAVE ALSO BEEN THE DIET IN DOCTOR 3S STUDY IT TALKED ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF MEN WHO WERE FED REALLY POOR DIETS AND KEPT REALLY CLEAN AND ANOTHER GROUP OF MEN WHO WERE FED REALLY GOOD RICH IN PROTEIN DIETS AND KEPT NOT AS CLEAN THE MEN WHO HAD THE POOR DIETS SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE X AND THE MEN WHO HAD REALLY GOOD DIETS BUT KEPT RATHER DIRTY SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE AT ALL AFTER READING DOCTOR 1S STUDY I HAD AN IDEA THAT IT WAS DIET BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE INFECTED WERE FROM THE SAME TOWN AND SOME HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANYONE THAT HAD DISEASE X BUT THEN READING DOCTOR 2S I CHANGED MY MIND A LITTLE AND THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THERE WAS A LITTLE CHANCE THE DISEASE COULD BE A VIRUS BECAUSE OF THE SICK CHICKEN AFTER READING DOCTOR 3S RESULTS I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT THE DISEASE WAS A DIETARY DEFICIENCY I RULED OUT GENETIC DISEASE COMPLETELY BECAUSE NEIGHBORS IN DOCTOR 1S STUDY WERE SICK AND BECAUSE THE MEN IN DOCTOR 3S STUDIES WERE RANDOMLY CHOSEN AND HAD NEVER HAD THE DISEASE	4239	THE BACTERIUM VIRUS EXPLANATION AND THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY EXPLANATION BOTH SEEM PLAUSIBLE THE GENETIC EXPLANATION SEEMS DUBIOUS BECAUSE DOCTOR 1S STUDY INDICATES A HIGH INCIDENCE OF DISEASE AMONG NEIGHBORS WHOM I ASSUME TO BE RELATED RARELY BUT TO SHARE A SIMILAR DIET AND COMMON BACTERIA AND VIRUSES OFTEN DOCTOR 2S STUDY FOLLOWS A HYPOTHESIS THAT A BACTERIUM CAUSES THE DISEASE AND THE DATA APPEAR TO SUPPORT THAT ALTHOUGH THERE COULD ALSO BE DIETARY DEFICIENCIES INVOLVED IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE BACTERIUM FIRST CAUSES MALABSORPTION BUT THAT A NUTRIENT RICH DIET CAN COMPENSATE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND PREVENT THE MANIFESTATION OF THE DISEASE SINCE ALL THE CHICKENS RECEIVED THE SAME BACTERIA DOSAGE ONE HAS TO INQUIRE WHY ONLY ONE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DIET PLAYED A ROLE PERHAPS FOR EXAMPLE CHICKEN 5 DIDNT EAT ENOUGH OF THE AVAILABLE WHOLE GRAINS THE DIETARY FACTOR IS UNKNOWN IN THIS CASE BUT THE BACTERIAL FACTOR IS CLEAR AND THEREFORE I CONCLUDE THAT THE BACTERIUM DEFINITELY PLAYED SOME ROLE AND DIET MAY HAVE AS WELL DOCTOR 3S STUDY IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS EVEN IN A CLEAN HOUSE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN CLOSE CAN SHARE GERMS DESPITE THE SURROUNDING CLEANLINESS THEY MAY SHAKE HANDS HUG SHARE UTENSILS ETC AT THE SAME TIME POOR DIET MAY HAVE LOWERED THEIR RESISTANCE TO WHATEVER GERMS THEY WERE SHARING WHILE THE RICH DIET OF THE OTHER HOUSEHOLD TOGETHER WITH THEIR ABILITY TO EXIT THEIR HOUSE MAY HAVE LEFT THEM LESS VULNERABLE IT IS OF COURSE ALSO POSSIBLE THAT ONLY ONE PERSON AMONG THE 31 HAD ANY PRIOR EXPOSURE TO THE DISEASE AND THAT HE HAPPENED TO LAND IN THE CLEAN HOUSE WITH THE POOR DIET IN ANY EVENT HOWEVER POOR DIET ALONE CLEARLY DID NOT CAUSE THE DISEASE BECAUSE 5 MEN ATE A POOR DIET FOR 3 MONTHS WITHOUT MANIFESTING IT THEREFORE I CONCLUDE THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE IS BACTERIAL BUT THAT DIET MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE	4240	FOR THE FIRST 2 STUDIES WE CAN TELL THE DISEASE X IS BY BACTERIA IN THE FIRST STUDY THE PEOPLE HAS DISEASE X ARE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR IN THE NEIGHBOR HOOD THIS SHOWS THAT THEY ARE PASSING THE DISEASE X AROUND IN THE SECOND STUDY IT CLEARLY SHOW THAT BACTERIA 5 IS CAUSE THE DISEASE X IN CHICKEN THE THIRD STUDY SEEMS TO BE THE DIET CAUSE THE DISEASE X BUT IT IS NOT REALLY THE 11 MEN WHO EAT POOR DIET WHICH HAS MORE CARBOHYDRATES AND MUCH LESS PROTEIN THAN THE AVERAGE DIET AND 6 OF THEM HAVE DISEASE X WHICH MEAN BECAUSE THEY EAT POOR DIET SO THEIR BODY IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK THE BACTERIA WHEN IT GOES TO THEIR BODY	4241	BECAUSE IN ALL THREE OF THE EXPERIMENTS IT HAD ISSUES THAT SHOWED OF THAT THERE WAS TRANSMITTING OR SIGNS OF TRANSMITTING BACTERIA AND VIRUSES WHICH ALL THREE EXPERIMENTS WERE EVIDENT IN THE FIRST ONE IT SHOWED THAT THE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO LIVE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER HAD MORE POSSIBILITIES OF GAINING THE DISEASE X WHEREAS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DONT LIVE WITH PEOPLE BESIDE THE DISEASE X PEOPLE IT WAS LESS LIKELY FOR THEM TO GAIN THE DISEASE OVER IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE THE CHICKENS CONTAMINATED FOOD AND ONCE IT WAS GIVEN TO THOSE CHICKENS THEY GOT THE DISEASE X AS A RESULT IT WAS THE CONTAMINATION OF THE CHICKENS THAT CAUSED ALL OF IT TO HAPPEN AND ON THE LAST ONE IT WAS THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD THE CLEAN HOUSES BUT BAD DIET THAT GOT THE DISEASE X PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT CONTAMINATION IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT THEN WITH THE PEOPLE HAVING A BAD DIET THE PEOPLE ARE MORE PRONE TO HAVING OTHER COLDS AND FLUS GIVING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WHOLE ROOM WITH CONTAMINATION OF GERMS AND BACTERIA AS A RESULT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS KEPT CLEAN BUT WITH THE GERMS IT STILL HAS CONTAMINATION	4242	FROM DOCTOR 1S STUDY IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD TEND TO GET IT SINCE NOT SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE IN THE SAME HOUSE GET IT WOULDNT APPEAR TO BE EITHER GERM OR GENETIC RELATED ASSUMING THAT MOST PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER ARE RELATED THE FACT THAT PEOPLE IN THE SAME GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD GOT IT AND ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE OF THE SAME AREA HAVE SIMILAR INCOMES AND DIETARY HABITS OPTIONS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE DIET RELATED ALSO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE DISEASE 16 GOT IT MORE OFTEN THAN THOSE WHO HAD PHYSICALLY DISTANT RELATIVES WITH IT 7 ALSO POINTS TO A DIET AS OPPOSED TO GENETIC OR GERM RELATED EXPLANATION FROM DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE FACT THAT THE SICK CHICKEN WAS ORIGINALLY HEALTHY WHEN IT HAD A HEALTHY DIET AND THEN GOT BETTER AFTER ITS DIET IMPROVED POINTS TO A DIET RELATED CAUSE ONE COULD POSTULATE THAT SINCE THEY ALL HAD THE SAME POOR DIET JUST DIFFERENT BACTERIAL STRAINS THAT CHICKEN 5 WAS PERHAPS MORE GENETICALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DIET RELATED DISEASE THAN HIS PEERS HOWEVER ONE COULD ALSO POSTULATE THAT PERHAPS ONLY BACTERIA 5 WAS VIRULENT FROM DOCTOR 3S STUDY THE FACT THAT THE DIRTY PEOPLE ON A GOOD DIET REMAINED HEALTHY WHILE THE CLEAN PEOPLE ON A POOR DIET GOT SICK POINTS TO A DIET RELATED CAUSE	4243	I THINK THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE IF DISEASE X IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY THOUGH FOOD WAS NOT MENTIONED PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE OR CLOSE BY HAD THE DISEASE THIS SOUNDS MORE BACTERIAL BUT THEY COULD HAVE NOT HAD THE PROPER DIET NEEDED IN THAT AREA IN DOCTOR 2S STUDY THE CHICKENS WERE GIVEN UNPOLISHED RICE WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN UNHEALTHY DIET ALONG WITH THE BACTERIA THEY WERE BEING FED DOCTOR 3S STUDY IS MOST EVIDENT THAT IT IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY HAVING MEN LIVE IN A CLEAN HOUSE WITH NO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND A POOR DIET CONTRACT THE DISEASE MAKES ME FEEL IT IS TOTALLY DIETARY WHEN OTHER MEN ARE LIVING IN A DIRTY HOUSE IN CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE MORE GERMS AND LIVE OFF OF A FULL NORMAL DIET DONT CONTRACT THE DISEASE IT MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT IT IS DIETARY AS LONG AS DIETARY NEEDS ARE MET DISEASE X SHOULD NOT BE A MAJOR PROBLEM	4244	DOCTOR 1 GIVES US VERY GENERAL SURVEY ABOUT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE STARTING FROM HIS DATA I THINK THAT THE DISEASE IS NOT GENETIC SINCE THERE ARE PEOPLE NOT RELATED WITH THE SICK ONES THAT HAD THE DISEASE LATER THE DISEASE IS NOT SPREAD BY BACTERIA OR VIRUS SINCE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DIDNT HAVE CONTACT AT ALL WITH THE SICK ONE SO THE ONLY WAY THAT I THINK THE DISEASE IS TRANSMITTED IS THE THIRD ONE DIETARY DEFICIENCY SINCE THESE PEOPLE IS LIVING IN THE SAME AREA AND THE FOOD RESOURCES AND THE WAY OF LIVING ARE THE SAME GENERALLY DOCTOR 2 STUDY IS MORE SCIENTIFIC SINCE HE IS DOING A DEEPER EXPERIMENT THE WAY CHICKENS WERE FEED SHOWS ME THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE DISEASE WAS SPREAD WAS THE BACTERIA 5 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE CORN MEAL DIET MIGHT BE A REASON THAT THESE BACTERIA CAN BE A BASE FOR THE DISEASE DEVELOPMENT DOCTOR 3 STUDY ENFORCED ON ME THAT THE REASON WHY THE SICKNESS WAS SPREAD WAS THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY THE WAY OF LIVING CLEANNESS AND COLLECTIVENESS WERE NOT REASON THAT THE SICKNESS TO BE DEVELOPED	4245	THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRST CASE STUDY PEOPLE WHO GOT DISEASE X LIVED EITHER NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER OR IN THE SAME HOUSE BECAUSE THEY LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER THESE FAMILIES MIGHT HAVE THE SAME DIET FOR THE SECOND CASE THE CHICKEN THAT GOT SICK WAS FED BACTERIA 5 IT COULD BE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE BACTERIA THAT CAUSED THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN THE CHICKENS DIET FOR THE THIRD CASE THE MEN WITH THE POOR DIET GOT DISEASE X SO DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE	4246	I HAVE CHECK THE DIETARY DEFICIENCY AS WHAT LEAD PEOPLE DEVELOP DISEASE X THAT IS BECAUSE IN CASE 1 MOST PEOPLE THAT GOT SICK LIVED IN THE SAME AREAS WHICH MEANT THAT THEY ALL WERE LIKELY TO HAVE THE SAME CONDITIONS IN HOUSING AND DIET ITS JUST LIKE IN A POPULATION WHERE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS EITHER HAVE THE SAME CONDITIONS OR VERY SIMILAR ALSO IN CASE 2 THE CHICKENS WERE TREATED WITH DIFFERENT BACTERIA BUT WE ALL EAT BACTERIA IN OUR FOOD WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE WAS WHEN THE SICK CHICKEN ATE A DIFFERENT DIET ALSO IN CASE 3 THE PEOPLE THAT HAD A POOR DIET DID BECAME ILL BUT THE PEOPLE WITH RICH DIET WERE ALL HEALTHY	4247	TAKING ALL 3 STUDIES INTO ACCOUNT DIETARY DEFICIENCY IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE THIRD STUDY NONE OF THE MEN WERE RELATED SO GENETICS CAN BE EXCLUDED AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE DISEASE ALSO SINCE THE TEST GROUP FROM THE THIRD STUDY WERE ISOLATED FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE BEGINNING THE POOR DIET BACTERIAL VIRAL CAUSES COULD ALSO BE EXCLUDED BECAUSE IF ANY OF THE SUBJECTS CARRIED BACTERIA OR VIRUS IT WOULD HAVE INFECTED THE OTHER MEN DURING THE FIRST 3 MONTHS SO THAT JUST LEAVES THE DIET TO BLAME THE FIRST STUDY INVOLVED MOSTLY PEOPLE LIVING EITHER IN THE SAME HOUSE OR NEXT DOOR TO PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE I CAN INFER FROM THIS DESCRIPTION THAT MOST LIKELY IF YOU LIVE WITH OR NEAR ONE OF THESE PEOPLE YOU PROBABLY SHARE THE SAME ECONOMIC POSITION THE DISEASE WAS MOST LIKELY MORE COMMON IN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO EAT A PROPER DIET IN THE 2ND STUDY THE CHICKEN ALL ATE A DIET IF POLISHED RICE WHICH DOESNT HAVE MUCH NUTRITION MAYBE THE CHICKEN WHO ATE TYPE 5 BACTERIA WAS ACTUALLY JUST GETTING EITHER VITAMIN DEFICIENT BLOOD OR VITAMIN DEFICIENT FOOD SAMPLES FROM TYPE 5 THE OTHER CHICKENS WERE PROBABLY GETTING SOME KIND OF NUTRIENT FROM THE SO CALLED BACTERIA THEY WERE FED	4248	I DONT THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WITH MUCH CONFIDENCE SINCE EACH OF THE THREE STUDIES ONLY ADDRESSES TWO OF THE THREE POSSIBLE CAUSES HOWEVER SINCE A BACTERIAL COMPONENT WAS INDICATED IN EACH OF THE THREE STUDIES I CHOSE IT AS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT STRONG EVIDENCE SINCE IN THE FIRST STUDY NO INFORMATION ABOUT DIET WAS GIVEN AND IN THE SECOND AND THIRD STUDIES A GENETIC COMPONENT TO DEVELOPING THE DISEASES WAS NOT ADDRESSED THE FIRST STUDY STRONGLY POINT TO A BACTERIAL VIRAL CAUSE SINCE 86 OF PEOPLE WERE EITHER IN PROXIMITY 80 OR HAD CONTACT THROUGH RELATIVE 6 WITH THE DISEASE WHEREAS A GENETIC CAUSE IS LESS STRONGLY INDICATED BY ONLY 30 OF PEOPLE HAVING RELATIVES WITH DISEASE X ASSUMING PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE ARE RELATIVES AND NOT UNRELATED ROOMMATES IN THE SECOND STUDY A POOR CORRELATION EXISTS BETWEEN BACTERIA AND THE DISEASE ONLY 1 9 BUT IT DOES EXIST DIET IS INDICATED PERHAPS MORE STRONGLY BY THE FACT THAT THE CHICKEN IMPROVED UPON RECEIVING A GOOD DIET HOWEVER THE INTRODUCTION SAID THAT IN HUMANS THE SYMPTOMS MAY DISAPPEAR FOR A TIME BUT THEN COME BACK LATER IN LIFE SO THE SECOND STUDY PROVIDES SOME ALTHOUGH FAIRLY WEAK DATA FOR EITHER A BACTERIAL OR A DIETARY CAUSE THE THIRD STUDY INDICATES THAT DIET PLAYS A STRONG ROLE SINCE NONE OF THE MEN WITH A RICH DIET BECAME ILL BUT A POOR DIET MIGHT JUST MAKE PEOPLE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A BACTERIAL INFECTION OR TO SUCCUMBING TO A PREDISPOSED GENETIC AILMENT ONE OF THE POOR DIET MEN MAY HAVE HAD DISEASE X BACTERIAL VIRAL INFECTION ALREADY BUT WAS NOT SHOWING SYMPTOMS AND THEN GIVEN IT TO THE OTHERS WHO WERE IN A CLOSED SYSTEM WITH HIM THUS ALTHOUGH A DIETARY COMPONENT IS STRONGLY INDICATED A BACTERIAL VIRAL CAUSE IS NOT RULED OUT SO THE THREE STUDIES ALL CONTAIN POTENTIAL EVIDENCE FOR A BACTERIAL CAUSE DIET IS THE NEXT CAUSE THAT IS MOST INDICATED BY THE STUDIES HOWEVER MORE DIRECTED STUDY WITH BETTER CONTROLS ARE NEEDED TO SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY	4249	NONE OF THESE STUDIES LOOKED AT FAMILIES SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE A GENETIC DISEASE BASED ON THE DATA HOWEVER BASED ON THE INFORMATION GIVEN BEFORE THE STUDIES THAT THIS DISEASE WAS EPIDEMIC DURING A CERTAIN PERIOD I EXPECT THAT IT HAS AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT IF IT WERE ENTIRELY GENETIC ONE WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE AN EPIDEMIC IN A WHOLE REGION IT IS OF COURSE POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISEASE WHILE THE DISEASE IS TRIGGERED BY SOMETHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT DIETARY OR BIOLOGICAL IN THE FIRST STUDY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THE DISEASE WHEN THEIR NEIGHBOR HAD IT THAN WHEN SOME ONE IN THEIR OWN HOUSE HAD IT DID NOT POINT STRONGLY TO A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOWEVER THAT STUDY DIDNT RULE OUT ANY OF THE THREE CAUSES THE SECOND STUDY MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THE DISEASE COULD BE BACTERIAL HOWEVER ONLY ONE OF THE NINE BACTERIAL SAMPLES FROM DISEASE X PATIENTS MIGHT HAVE CAUSED DISEASE IN ONE CHICKEN THE CHICKEN MAY HAVE GOTTEN SICK FROM SOME OTHER CAUSE THERE WAS NO CONTROL GROUP TO COMPARE WITH THIS STUDY IS NOT CONCLUSIVE IF THE DISEASE WERE CAUSED BY BLOOD BORN BACTERIA AND WERE ABLE TO INFECT CHICKENS AS SUGGESTED THEN ALL THE CHICKENS FED CORN INFECTED WITH BACTERIAL SAMPLES FROM BLOOD WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP DISEASE OR MOST BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE NINE SELECTED BACTERIAL SAMPLES COME FROM IF NONE OF THE CHICKENS HAD GOTTEN SICK THE DISEASE COULD STILL BE BACTERIAL EITHER NOT IN THE BLOOD OR UNABLE TO INFECT CHICKENS I DONT FEEL LIKE I REALLY LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THAT STUDY I LIKE THE THIRD STUDY BETTER EXCEPT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SET UP A CONTROL GROUP THEIR 20 MEN GETTING HEALTHY DIETS WERE LIVING A VERY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE FROM THE 11 ON UNHEALTHY DIETS THEY COULD HAVE SPLIT THE 20 INTO TWO GROUPS OF 10 AND SET UP ONE AS A CONTROL TO HELP SEPARATE THEIR THREE VARIABLES 1 DIET 2 CLEANLINESS 3 CONTACT WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE THIS STUDY IS UNCERTAIN IN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DIDNT HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHERS MAY HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY WERE ALL SUPPOSEDLY HEALTHY BUT IF ONE SOMEHOW BROUGHT IN A CONTAGION THE OTHER 5 WHO GOT SICK COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT THEREFORE WE CANNOT BE POSITIVE THAT THIS STUDY RULES OUT CONTAGION HOWEVER ASSUMING THAT THERE IS DISEASE IN THE COMMUNITY VISITED BY THE HEALTHY DIET GROUP CONTAGION IS NOT LIKELY TO EXPLAIN THE LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS I SAY THAT GENETIC DISEASE IS STILL POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION ON THE RELATEDNESS OF THE MEN IN THE STUDY PERHAPS THE 6 WHO GOT SICK WERE ALL BROTHERS WE DO NOT KNOW I HOPE THE RESEARCHER CHOSE UNRELATED PEOPLE IF SO THEN IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT DIETARY DEFICIENCY CAUSED THE DISEASE ALSO I MUST ADMIT THAT THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF HUNCHING IN MY CHOICE OF MOST LIKELY CAUSE THAT SET OF SYMPTOMS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD RESULT FROM DIETARY DEFICIENCY CALL THAT BIAS RETURNING TO THE FIRST STUDY THE FINDING THAT PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER WERE LESS LIKELY TO ALL HAVE THE DISEASE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE DIET HYPOTHESIS BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THAT IN GENERAL PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER ARE EATING THE SAME FOOD IF DIET IS INVOLVED IT IS LIKELY THAT OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS AGE SEX OR GENETIC PREDISPOSITION ALSO CONTRIBUTE	4250	IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CLEARLY IN CASE 2 THE DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY THE BACTERIA ISOLATED AND FED TO THE CHICKEN ONE MUST ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CHICKEN WAS ALSO GIVEN A HEFTY DOSE OF THE BACTERIA DAILY IN CASE 1 IT ALSO SEEMS LIKELY THAT IT WAS BACTERIAL SINCE MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS DID HAVE CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER CASE THREE SEEMS TO CLEARLY MEAN THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS NUTRITIONAL HOWEVER ALL OF THE MEN STAYED IN CLOSE CONTACT IN THE SAME HOUSE SO IF ONE OF THEM MYSTERIOUSLY DID CARRY THE DISEASE HE COULD HAVE TRANSMITTED IT TO THE OTHERS AS A KIND OF FLUKE MAYBE IT WAS DORMANT FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE MONITORED BEFORE THE STUDY BEGAN HOWEVER WHAT IF DISEASE X WAS A BACTERIA VIRUS THAT IS CARRIED NORMALLY IN HUMANS AND IN CASES OF BODILY STRESS LIKE POOR NUTRITION ETC THE DISEASE MANIFESTS ITSELF THIS POINTING AGAIN TO A BACTERIAL CAUSE AND NOT NUTRITION	4251	THE FIRST DOCTORS STUDY WAS AMBIGUOUS AS TO WHAT EXACTLY CAUSED DISEASE X THE SECOND DOCTORS STUDY SEEMED CLEARLY THE CAUSE WAS FROM A BACTERIA AND THE THIRD SEEMED THE CAUSE WAS CLEARLY A DIETARY PROBLEM SO IT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO CATEGORIZE THE FIRST STUDY ALTHOUGH THERE IS AMBIGUITY I WOULD THINK IF PEOPLE LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE THEY WOULD EAT RELATIVELY THE SAME DIET ALTHOUGH THIS ISNT NECESSARILY TRUE I WOULD ALSO THINK THAT PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER MAY EAT SIMILARLY IN TERMS OF SHARED RESOURCES SUCH AS WATER AND IN TERMS OF LIVING IN THE SAME REGION IT SEEMS THAT IF THE STUDY ENCOMPASSED A BROADER RANGE OF THE COUNTRY IF THE DISEASE X EXISTS WIDELY IT MIGHT BE LESS AMBIGUOUS WELL PERHAPS THERE IS A LACK OF IONS THAT CAUSES THIS DISEASE IT SEEMS LIKE IF IT WERE CAUSED BY BACTERIA THERE WOULD BE MORE INFECTIONS WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD BASED ON THIS I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST STUDY CONCLUDES A DIETARY CAUSE OF DISEASE X	4252	THE MOST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS A DIETARY RELATED DISEASE IS THE RESULTS FROM DOCTOR 3S EXPERIMENT POOR DIET LED TO POOR HEALTH DOCTOR 2S STUDY LEADS TO A BACTERIAL PATHOGEN AND PRESENTS THE MOST OPPOSITION TO MY CONCLUSION HOWEVER A BACTERIA THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY HARMFUL TO CELLS COULD BREAK DOWN CERTAIN VITAMINS IN FOOD DOCTOR 1S STUDY COULD EASILY BE LINKED TO A DIETARY INEFFICIENCY PEOPLE IN SIMILAR LIVING CONDITIONS IE LIVE IN THE SAME AREAS ARE USUALLY IN THE SAME ECONOMIC CLASSES ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS COULD LEAD TO INEFFICIENT DIETS WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE DISEASE	4253	BECAUSE NONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS PROVED ONE CAUSE TO BE ABSOLUTELY WRONG FROM THE INFORMATION GIVEN ON STUDY 1 I CAN SUGGEST THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE WAS GENETIC SINCE IT IS NOT PROVEN WRONG IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE NO CONTROLS THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT VARIABLE ALSO THE FACT THAT FROM THE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS MOST OF THEM WHERE IN CONTACT WE CAN SUGGEST A BACTERIUM OR VIRUS CAUSE BUT AGAIN SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE RECALLED BEING IN CONTACT WITH AN AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL AND SINCE THE SYMPTOMS MAY GO FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME INDIVIDUALS THAT LOOK HEALTHY MAY NOT REALLY BE HEALTHY THEREFORE ONLY A TESTIMONY OF A PERSON SAYING IF THEY HAVE OR HAVE NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH AN AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONCLUDE ANYTHING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF DIETARY DEFICIENCY WAS NOT TESTED IN THIS STUDY THEREFORE IT MAY ALSO BE A PROBABLE CAUSE STUDY 1 DOES NOT CANCEL ANY OF THE HYPOTHESIS PRESENTED ABOVE STUDY 2 DOES NOT CANCEL ANY OF THE HYPOTHESIS EITHER THE FACT THAT WE DONT KNOW THE GENETIC RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE NINE CHICKENS ITS TELLING US THAT THE GENETIC VARIABLE WAS NOT REALLY TESTED THE BACTERIUM VIRUS CAUSE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TESTED BUT I DONT CONSIDER THIS STUDY TO BE VERY COMPLETE FIRST OF ALL NOT ALL THE BACTERIA FROM THE BLOOD SAMPLE WHERE TESTED THEREFORE THE RIGHT BACTERIA MY NOT HAVE BEEN TESTED ALSO THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE SICKNESS AT THE SAME TIME AND THE BACTERIA TESTED MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN PROVING ANOTHER SICKNESS ALSO CHICKENS ARE NOT HUMANS DIFFERENT BODIES DIFFERENT REACTIONS I DONT BELIEVE THAT THIS TEST TOOK CARE OF THE CAUSE OF DIETARY DEFICIENCY THEREFORE IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THE THIRD TEST ALSO DIDNT PROVE ANY OF OUR OPTIONS WRONG THE GENETIC RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE MEN ITS UNKNOWN WE ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THIS MEN DIDNT HAVE THE DISEASE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY CLEAN THE HOUSE IT DOES REALLY TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE NO BACTERIA OR VIRUSES IN THE PLACE ALSO A DIETARY DEFICIENCY WAS NOT PROVEN RIGHT AND AT THE SAME TIME HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN WRONG THEREFORE I CANNOT CONCLUDE ANYTHING FROM ANY EXPERIMENT	4254	STUDY 1 SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT CONTACT PLAYED A ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF DISEASE X ALTHOUGH PRESUMABLY THE HEALTHY PEOPLE WERE ALSO IN CONTACT WITH CONTAMINATION WHETHER THROUGH CONTACT OR FOOD STUDY 2 ALSO SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT A PARTICULAR BACTERIA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISEASE X ALTHOUGH IT WAS A VERY POOR SAMPLE SIZE WITH ONLY 1 CHICKEN ON THE DIET STUDY 3 DID NOT SEEM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT POOR DIET PROBABLY MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY SORT OF INFECTION EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED IN A CLEAN HOUSE SOME SORT OF CONTAMINATION IS POSSIBLE AND MAY HAVE HAD POOR RESISTANCE	4255	THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY I BELIEVE THAT DISEASE X IS CAUSED BY A DIETARY DEFICIENCY IN STUDY ONE THE DISEASE COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ANY OF THE THREE WAYS GENETIC BACTERIUM VIRUS OR DIETARY DEFICIENCY THERE IS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION PROVIDED IT ONLY SHOWS HOW THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWNS KNOW EACH OTHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DISEASE IS PASSED ON THROUGH GENES THE STUDY POPULATION IS SMALL AND THEREFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIVE DISEASES MAY BE HIGHER WE ARE NOT TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE DIET OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DISEASE X SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DIET IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE VIRUS COULD BE CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM VIRUS MANY OF THE PEOPLE WITH DISEASE X HAVE ENCOUNTERED ONE ANOTHER AND IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE WAS PASSED IN WAYS OTHER THAN CONTACT STUDY 2 SHOWS THAT ONE OF THE CHICKENS WAS FED A CORNMEAL DIET THAT WAS INFECTED WITH BACTERIA AND THE CHICKEN DEVELOPED DISEASE X WHEN THE CHICKEN WAS TAKEN OFF THE LOW NUTRIENT DIET THAT WAS INFECTED WITH THE BACTERIA THE CHICKEN GOT BETTER THIS STUDIES DOES NOT PROVE MUCH AS THERE ARE TWO VARIABLES THAT ARE CHANGED AT THE SAME TIME SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS A GENETIC VARIABLE THAT IS INFLUENCES THE EFFECTS OF THE DIET AND CONTAMINATION CASE STUDY 3 SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MEN THAT ATE A POOR DIET DEVELOPED DISEASE X AS A RESULT THE MEN LIVING IN THE DIRTY ENVIRONMENT HAD A HIGH NUTRIENT DIET AND DID NOT SHOW DISEASE X	4
