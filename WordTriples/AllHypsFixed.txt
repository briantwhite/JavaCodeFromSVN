1151	DURING OUR EXPERIMENT WE CAME UP WITH FIVE DIFFERENT HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT ALL THREE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS HELD TRUE FOR ONLY ONE OF THOSE HYPOTHESIS HYPOTHESIS THREE STATED THAT THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST SERVED AS A PROTECTOR THE CENTER WHICH WAS THE RED PART	2
1152	DURING THE SECOND WEEK MY GROUP HAD COME UP WITH A HYPOTHESIS BLOCK THAT THE RED CELLS WERE MALNOURISHED AND THE WHITE ONES WERE HEALTHY SO THIS HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT WHEN THE YEAST IS HEALTHY IT SHOULD BE WHITE AND WHEN IT IS DEPRIVED FROM NUTRIENTS IT WILL BE RED OR TURN RED THE CENTER IS USUALLY RED AND THE OUTSIDE LAYER WHITE BECAUSE IT HAS DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE NUTRIENTS	4
1153	EVENTUALLY OVER TIME WHITE WILL TURN RED	3

1167	HYPOTHESIS THERE IS ONE TYPE OF YEAST WITH TWO DIFFERENT COLOR CHARACTERISTICS RED AND WHITE THAT IT IS ABLE TO EXPRESS WHEN THERE ARE HARSH CONDITIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS A DEFENSE MECHANISM IN THE YEAST WILL BE TRIGGERED THIS DEFENSE MECHANISM IS REPRESENTED OR SHOWS UP AS A RED COLORED YEAST EXPLANATION THERE IS ONE STRAIN OF YEAST PRESENT ON THE PLATES GIVEN TO US IN THE LAB THIS YEAST IS CAPABLE OF EXPRESSING TWO DIFFERENT COLOR CHARACTERISTICS A WHITE COLOR AND A RED COLOR THE RED COLOR CHARACTERISTIC REPRESENTS AN ACTIVATION OF A DEFENSE MECHANISM OF THE YEAST THIS DEFENSIVE MECHANISM RED COLOR IS TURNED ON WHEN THE YEAST FINDS ITSELF IN HARSH CONDITIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS IE NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY OR NOT ENOUGH NUTRIENTS THIS ALLOWS THE YEAST TO CONTINUE TO GROW INSTEAD OF JUST DYING OUT WHEN FACED WITH THESE LESS THAN OPTIMAL CONDITIONS THE WHITE COLOR CHARACTERISTIC IS THE COLOR THAT THE YEAST WILL GROW WHEN FACED WITH OPTIMAL OR FRIENDLY CONDITIONS THE PLATES OF YEAST THAT WE RECEIVED WERE GROWING BOTH COLOR CHARACTERISTICS WHITE ON THE OUTSIDE AND RED ON THE INSIDE THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AS THE WHITE YEAST WERE GROWING OUT FINDING ITSELF IN OPTIMAL CONDITIONS IT PROCEEDED TO EAT UP AND TAKE UP MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE MIDDLE AFTER THE WHITE YEAST HAD EATEN AND GROWN OUT WERE NUTRIENTS THAT WERE NOT AS OPTIMAL AS THEY WERE TO BEGIN WITH IN ORDER TO CONTINUE GROWING THE YEAST TURNED ON ITS DEFENSE MECHANISM RED COLOR AND WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE GROWING THE QUESTION OF WHY SPECIFICALLY THE YEAST TURNED RED IS ONE OF A BIOCHEMICAL NATURE THE RED COLOR MAY BE THE RESULT OF A DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCE BEING METABOLIZED FOR INSTANCE A SHIFT FROM BURNING GLUCOSE TO BURNING LACTOSE A LESS DESIRABLE ENERGY SOURCE COULD CAUSE AN ENZYMATIC CASCADE OF EVENTS A FUNCTION OF A SEPARATE OPERON BEING ACTIVATED RESULTING IN AN EXPRESSION OF RED HOWEVER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXACT EVENTS LEADING TO A DIFFERENT COLOR EXPRESSION WE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT A NUTRIENT DEFICIENT AGAR IS IN RELATION TO A NUTRIENT SUFFICIENT ONE AND WE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO EMBARK ON FURTHER MORE DETAILED EXPERIMENTS	4
1168	HYPOTHESIS WHITE YEAST CELL SAMPLES WILL GROW RED YEAST CELL CENTERS WE LOOKED AT THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE OF YEAST AND THOUGHT THAT IF WE TOOK SMALL SAMPLES OF WHITE YEAST GROWTH THEY WOULD GROW RED CENTERS OF YEAST CELLS TO FORM GROWTHS LIKE THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE WE OBSERVED	2
1169	HYPOTHESIS YEAST CELLS WHITE IN COLOR WHEN WELL FED ARE PINKISH RED WHEN DEPRIVED OF A NUTRIENTS ARGUMENT YEAST CELLS GROWING ON REGULAR AGAR WHICH CONTAINS AN ADDITIONAL NUTRIENT VERSUS STRIPED AGAR ARE WHITE THEY OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY NUTRIENTS AND METABOLIZE THEM NORMALLY AS THEY EXPAND OUTWARD THEY EXHAUST THE CRITICAL NUTRIENT WHERE MANY CELLS HAVE ALREADY GROWN NEW YEAST CELLS IN THIS CENTER AREA ARE PINK DUE TO THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF THE NUTRIENT AVAILABLE YEAST CELLS GROWING ON THE NUTRIENT DEFICIENT STRIPED AGAR ARE DEEP RED THEY ARE INTENSELY COLORED DUE TO ZERO AVAILABILITY OF THE CRITICAL NUTRIENT	4
1170	HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE TWO DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS AFFECTS THE GROWTH OF THE YEAST	1
1171	I BELIEVE THAT THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST IS DEAD AND THE RED PART OF THE YEAST IS ALIVE	3
1172	I CHOOSE HYPOTHESIS THREE WHICH IS RED CELLS DOES NOT GROW IN SIZE OR WHITE CELLS GROW MORE RAPIDLY THAN RED CELLS I FEEL THAT THE DATA WE HAVE COLLECTED SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS	3
1173	I CHOSE THE SECOND PART OF HYPOTHESIS ONE THIS HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD BUT THE RED ONE IS ALIVE FOR THIS QUESTION WE WILL USE THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE PART	3
1174	I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE DIFFERENT NUTRIENT WILL AFFECT THE GROWTH OF THE YEAST SUCH AS COLOR AND STRUCTURE	1
1175	I HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE RED YEAST IS RED SINCE IT HAS NO ACCESS TO THE AGAR NUTRIENTS ITS ACCESS IS CUT OFF BY THE RING OF WHITE YEAST WHITE YEAST IS WHITE BECAUSE IT HAS ACCESS TO NUTRIENTS ON AGAR SO IF WHITE YEAST IS PLACED ON RED YEAST IT SHOULD TURN RED	3
1176	I HYPOTHESIZES THAT THE BOTH THE RED AND WHITE YEAST ARE ALIVE AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLORS BETWEEN THE YEAST IS DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF NUTRIENTS	2
1177	IF A STRAIN OF YEAST IS GROWING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE HARSH OR NOT IDEAL FOR THAT PARTICULAR STRAIN OF YEAST THE YEAST WILL REACT WITH A DEFENSE MECHANISM UNDER WHICH ONLY A RED COLOR OF YEAST WILL GROW	2
1178	IF RED AND WHITE CELLS ARE SEPARATED AND GIVEN NUTRIENTS THEN THE WHITE CELLS WILL GROW BECAUSE THEY ARE ALIVE AND THE RED WILL STAY THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD	3
1179	IF RED YEAST CELLS AND WHITE YEAST CELLS ARE SEPARATED AND PUT ONTO THE SAME PETRI DISH WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS THEN THE WHITE CELLS WILL GROW AND REMAIN WHITE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALIVE AND THE RED CELLS WILL REMAIN RED BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD	3
1180	IF THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE ARE RED AND THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE ARE WHITE THEN THE OUTER CELLS ARE DEAD AND THE INNER CELLS ARE ALIVE	3
1181	IF THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE ARE GETTING LESS NUTRIENTS THAN THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE THE CELLS IN THE VERY CENTER WILL BE DARKEST SHADE OF RED AND THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE WILL BE WHITE	3
1182	IF THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE ARE HYDROPHILIC AND THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE ARE HYDROPHOBIC THEN THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE WILL BE WHITE AND THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE WILL BE RED	3
1183	IF THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE ARE WHITE AND THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE ARE RED THEN THE OUTER CELLS HAVE DIED AND THE INNER CELLS ARE STILL LIVING	3
1184	IF THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE ARE WHITE AND THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE ARE RED THEN THE OUTER CELLS HAVE DIED AND THE INNER CELLS ARE STILL LIVING	3
1185	IF THE INNER CELLS ARE BUDDING AND DIVIDING BECAUSE OF NUTRIENTS ADDED THEN ENERGY AND HEAT IS RELEASED CAUSING CELLS TO TURN RED	2
1186	IF THE INNER CELLS USE ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS THEN THE CELLS DIE AND CHANGE COLOR TO RED	2
1187	IF THE RED CENTER IS HYDROPHOBIC THEN THE EDGE IS HYDROPHILIC	3
1188	IF THE RED CENTER SIGNIFIES A STARVED CELL NOT A DEAD CELL THEN RED CELLS FROM THE FIRST DISH WITHOUT AGAR SHOULD START TO FEED AND DEVELOP A WHITE EDGE	2
1189	IF THE RED CENTER SIGNIFIES A STARVED CELL THEN THE PETRI DISH SHOULD ONLY HAVE RED CELLS WHEN THE AGAR IS GONE	2
1190	IF THE WHITE CELLS ARE A BYPRODUCT OF THE RED CELLS THEN THE WHITE CELLS SHOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE RED CELLS SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE	2
1191	IF THE WHITE CELLS ARE THE YEAST CELLS AND THE RED CELL ARE THE BYPRODUCT OF THE WHITE CELLS THEN WHITE CELLS SHOULD APPEAR FIRST THEN RED CELLS SHOULD APPEAR LATER	2
1192	IF THE YEAST GREW IN A DIFFERENT PLACE IN THE PLATE OTHER THAN THE CENTER IT WILL GROW DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE NUTRIENTS ARE NOT SPREAD EVENLY	1
1193	IF THE YEAST IS LACKING COMPONENTS OF NUTRIENTS THE WHITE PART WILL NOT APPEAR	2
1194	IF THE YEAST IS LACKING COMPONENTS OF NUTRIENTS THE WHITE PART WILL NOT APPEAR	2
1195	IF THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STRAINS OF YEAST ON THE AGAR PLATE THERE WILL BE TWO DIFFERENT COLORS	2
1196	IF WHITE IS APPLIED ON TOP OF THE RED PART OF THE YEAST THE WHITE WILL BECOME THE CENTER OF THE BACTERIA AND THE RED WILL BECOME THE OUTER EDGE	2
1197	IF WHITE IS NEW THEN IT WOULD EVENTUALLY TURN RED	3
1198	IF WHITE IS PUT INTO A PETRI DISH BY ITSELF NO RED WILL BE PRODUCED HOWEVER IF RED IS PLACED BY ITSELF IN A PETRI DISH WHITE WILL BE PRODUCED THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF WHITE WILL ALWAYS GROW OR IF RED DOES THE FACT THAT WHITE CONTINUES TO GROW EXPLAINS WHY THE WHITE IS ON THE OUTSIDE THE RED CELLS TO GROW SO IT IS LIMITED TO STAY ON THE INSIDE HOWEVER THE WHITE CONTINUES TO GROW SO IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE WITHOUT ANY INHIBITIONS TO STOP THE GROWTH AND IS FREE TO CONTINUE REACHING OUT	3
1199	IF WHITE YEAST IS GIVEN AMPLE ROOM AND NUTRIENTS IT WILL GROW AND WILL BE ALL WHITE	2
1200	IF YEAST IS GROWING UNDER HARSH CONDITIONS DEFENSE MECHANISM WILL BE TRIGGERED AND IT WILL GROW RED	2
1201	IN HYPOTHESIS ONE OF WEEK ONE WE STATED THAT WHITE COLORED YEAST ARE DEAD CELLS WHILE THE RED COLORED YEAST ARE LIVING CELLS AND REPRODUCING	3
1202	IN HYPOTHESIS ONE ON WEEK TWO IT WAS SUPPORTED WHICH SAID THAT WHITE CELL IS ACTIVE	1
1203	IN OUR LAB OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT RED CELLS ARE DEAD AND WHITE CELLS ARE ALIVE THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS REFUTED BY OUR EXPERIMENTS WE FOUND THAT BOTH CELLS GREW IN BOTH NUTRIENT RICH AND POOR CONTAINERS	3
1204	IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN THE WHITE YEAST WILL TURN RED	2
1205	IN THE POOR NUTRIENT DISH RED CELLS GROW MORE RAPIDLY	1
1206	IN THE RICH NUTRIENT DISH WHITE CELLS MORE RAPIDLY	0
1207	IN YELLOW NUTRIENT YEAST WILL GROW AT A FASTER RATE THEN IT WOULD IN THE WHITE NUTRIENT	2
1208	INSTEAD OF SOME BEING RED AND SOME BEING WHITE THEY ALL CONTAIN RED PIGMENT ONLY THE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED GROUP OF CELLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAMPLE SHOWS THE COLOR WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THE YEAST GROWS FROM THE INSIDE OUTWARDS AND IS THEREFORE LESS CONCENTRATED ON THE PERIMETER	3
1209	IT WAS STATED THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE COLOR OF THE YEAST IS BECAUSE THE RED YEAST IS DYING AS WHEN THE PETRI DISH IS LIFTED AND VIEWED FROM THE BOTTOM IT IS SEEN THAT ONLY THE WHITE PART IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE NUTRIENT MEDIUM AND NOT THE RED THUS THE LACK IN NUTRITION IS CAUSING THE CHANGE IN PIGMENT	2
1210	LACK OF NUTRIENTS MAKES THE YEAST RED	2
1211	LACK OF NUTRITION TURNS WHITE	2
1212	LACK OF O2 EQUALS WHITE CELLS RED HAS O2	3
1213	LAST WEEK WHITE SAMPLE WILL GROW RED CENTERS	2
1214	LIGHT EFFECTS THE PIGMENT	1
1215	MIXTURE OF RED AND WHITE WILL PRODUCE WHITE	2
1216	MORE NUTRIENTS PRODUCE WHITE CELLS	1
1217	MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS ARE INSIDE THE CELL THATS WHY THE OUTSIDE IS WHITE AND THE INSIDE IS RED	1
1218	MY GROUP AND I FEEL THAT THE DEFENSE MECHANISM HYPOTHESIS IS VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY THE DATA THAT WE COLLECTED FROM WEEK TWO THE HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT THE YEAST SAMPLES WE WORKED WITH CONSIST OF ONLY ONE STRAIN BUT HAS TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS IN THE FORM OF COLOR THE WHITE COLOR IS THE PREVALENT CHARACTERISTIC AND IS PRESENT WHENEVER THE YEAST IS GROWING IN A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER IF THE YEAST ENCOUNTERS A HARSH ENVIRONMENT EG GROWING IN A DEFICIENT NUTRIENT PETRI DISH THEN A DEFENSE MECHANISM IS TRIGGERED CAUSING THE YEAST TO GROW RED AND REPLACE THE WHITE	3
1219	MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT RED YEAST CELLS WITHOUT ANY WHITE CELLS GROW ONLY WHITE CELLS AROUND ITS OWN RED CELLS AND WHITE YEAST CELLS WHEN PLACED SEPARATELY WITHOUT RED ONLY GROWS WHITE CELLS THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN THOUGHT UP TO SEE HOW AND WHY THE YEAST CELLS GROW GEARING THE OBSERVATION TO THE GROWTH OF EITHER OF THE TWO	2
1220	MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE WHITE COLORED YEAST IS YOUNG AND WILL GROW MORE VIGOROUSLY THE RED COLORED YEAST IS OLDER AND MAY OR MAY NOT REPRODUCE AND IF IT DOES IT WILL DO SO SLOWLY	3
1221	MY HYPOTHESIS IS WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD CELLS AND RED CELLS ARE ALIVE BECAUSE THE EDGES ARE WHITE AND THE MIDDLE IS RED	3
1222	MY HYPOTHESIS RED MATERIAL ARE DEAD YEAST AND WHITE MATERIAL IS LIVING YEAST WE BELIEVE THAT THE RED MATERIAL THAT IS COLLECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POPULATION IS DEAD YEASTMAYBE LACK OF NUTRIENTS ON THE OTHER HAND THE WHITE MATERIAL THAT IS COLLECTED ON THE OUTER EDGES OF THIS POPULATION IS LIVE YEAST PROBABLY THESE YEAST HAVE MORE NUTRIENTS SO THEY GROW OUTBOUND	4
1223	MY HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT WHITE WILL MUTATE TO RED	3
1224	NONE WE ARE JUST INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN	0
1225	NUTRIENT RICH IS WHITE AND LOW NUTRIENT IS RED	3
1226	NUTRIENTS IN THE MIDDLE ARE DIFFERENT FROM NUTRIENTS ON THE FRINGES	2
1227	OLD YEAST IS RED AND WHITE AND YOUNG YEAST IS RED	2
1228	OLD YEAST IS THE RED AND THE YOUNG YEAST IS HE WHITE	3
1229	ONE AREA HAS MORE NUTRIENTS THAN THE OTHER WHICH WILL AFFECT THE RATE AT WHICH IT REPRODUCES	2
1230	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT WE HAD AND WE BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN IT BECAUSE OF OUR RESULTS WAS THE FOLLOWING WE BELIEVED THAT THE REASON THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAST WAS RED AND THE OUTSIDE WAS WHITE BECAUSE OF LACK OF NUTRITION WE BELIEVED THAT THE SIDES OF THE YEAST TOUCHING THE NUTRIENTS SHOULD TURN RED AND THE SIDES OF THE YEAST NOT GETTING NUTRITION AND NOT TOUCHING THE NUTRIENTS SHOULD TURN RED	0
1231	ONE HYPOTHESIS OUR GROUP MADE THAT WAS CONTRADICTED BY THE EVIDENCE WE COLLECTED WAS THAT THE RED COLORED YEAST CELLS WERE DEAD AND THE WHITE COLORED YEAST CELLS WERE ALIVE	3
1232	ONE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE PRESENCE OF A NUTRIENT IN THE REGULAR AGAR PLATE MAKES THE YEAST TURN WHITE THE RED YEAST RESULTS FROM CONDITIONS WHERE THE NUTRIENT IS ABSENT	3
1233	ONE HYPOTHESIS MY GROUP TESTED WAS THAT WHEN THE YEAST TURNS WHITE THE CONCENTRATION OF CELLS IN THAT AREA ARE DEAD	2
1234	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL IS VERY STRONGLY CONTRADICTED BY OUR DATA STATED THAT THE RED YEAST WAS LIVING AND THE WHITE YEAST WAS DEAD	3
1235	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL WAS STRONGLY CONTRADICTED BY THE DATA THAT MY GROUP COLLECTED WAS THAT A WHITE YEAST RING WILL ALWAYS FORM AROUND A RED YEAST BLOB IE IF A BLOB OF RED IS LEFT TO GROW AFTER THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD THERE WILL BE A WHITE YEAST BORDER AROUND THE RED YEAST CENTER	2
1236	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FELT WAS WELL SUPPORTED WAS THAT THE WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD I FELT THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS WELL SUPPORTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE RESULTS AGREED WITH THE PREDICTIONS FROM THIS HYPOTHESIS	2
1237	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT IS WELL CONTRADICTED IS THAT WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD AND THEREFORE NOT GOING TO BUD	2
1238	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT MY GROUP CAME UP WITH WAS THAT IF RED AND WHITE CELLS ARE SEPARATED AND GIVEN NUTRIENTS THEN THE WHITE CELLS WILL GROW BECAUSE THEY ARE ALIVE AND THE RED CELLS WILL STAY THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD	3
1239	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT SEEMS FAIRLY WELL SUPPORTED IS THAT RED YEAST IS DEFICIENT IN NUTRIENTS WHITE IS RICH IN NUTRIENTS	3
1240	ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT WAS WELL SUPPORTED BY OUR DATA WAS THE YEAST DEVELOPMENT IS NUTRIENT BASED WE BASICALLY WANTED TO DETERMINE IF THE YEAST WOULD GROW WITHOUT THE NUTRIENTS IN THE PLATE	1
1241	ONE HYPOTHESIS THE GROUP HAD THAT WAS WELL SUPPORTED WAS THAT THE WHITE YEAST WAS ALIVE OUR ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS STATED THAT THE WHITE YEAST WAS ALIVE WHILE THE RED YEAST WAS DEAD AFTER OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT IT WAS CHANGED TO ONLY SAY THAT WHITE YEAST WAS ALIVE AND GROWING	2
1242	ONE HYPOTHESIS WE CHOSE TO INVESTIGATE WAS THAT WHITE WAS DOMINANT TO RED AND RED WAS RECESSIVE	3
1243	ONE HYPOTHESIS WE CHOSE WHICH WAS VERY WELL SUPPORTED WAS THAT WHITE YEAST CELLS ARE ALIVE	2
1244	ONE HYPOTHESIS WE HAD WAS THAT THE WHITE OUTER RING HAS NOT BUDDED YET WHILE THE INSIDE RED PART HAS ALREADY BUDDED	3
1245	ONE OF MY GROUPS HYPOTHESES WAS THAT THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST WAS THE OLD AND DEAD PART AND IT HAD STOPPED GROWING WHICH WAS WHY IT WAS WHITE	2
1246	ONE OF OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST SERVED AS BARRIER THE YEAST CAN ONLY GROW WITH THE WHITE BARRIER WITHOUT IT WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY TO GROW OR WILL NOT GROW AT ALL	2
1247	ONLY ONE COLOR WILL GROW IN DARK PLACES	2
1248	ONLY THE RED YEAST IS GROWING AND ACTIVELY DIVIDING	2
1249	ONLY THE WHITE YEAST IS GROWING AND ACTIVELY DIVIDING	2
1250	OUR FIRST HYPOTHESIS WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT INCORPORATED A FUNDAMENTAL IDEA THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OTHER POTENTIAL HYPOTHESES IT WAS THE IDEA THAT THE RED SECTION OF THE YEAST WAS REPRODUCING AND THE WHITE YEAST WAS NOT ESSENTIALLY RED YEAST ALIVE WHITE YEAST DEAD	3
1251	OUR GROUP HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE RED CELLS DIDNT EXPAND IN GROWTH INSTEAD OF GROWING MORE RED CELLS LIKE THE WHITE CELLS THERE WERE WHITE CELLS SURROUNDING THE RED CELLS THE WHITE CELLS GREW ALONE MAKING MORE WHITE CELLS THIS MEANS THAT THE WHITE CELLS EXPANDED WHEN THE RED CELLS DID NOT THE RED CELLS DID NOT GROW IN TERMS OF EXPANDING BEYOND ITS PERIMETER WHEN WE MARKED THE RED CELLS TO SEE IF IT WOULD GROW	3
1252	OUR GROUPS HYPOTHESIS THREE FOR WEEK ONE WAS STRONGLY CONTRADICTORY TO DATA COLLECTED BY MY GROUP AND OTHERS OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT WHITE CELLS ARE OLD CELLS RED CELLS ARE YOUNG CELLS	3
1253	OUR HYPOTHESIS ONE FROM WEEK TWO STATES BROWN IN THE CENTER SIGNALS DEATH AS WE HAVE SEEN THE ORGANISM GROWS OUTWARD THE MOST ACTIVE ALIVE YEAST IS THE WHITE ON THE EDGE THE RED IS INTERMEDIATE AND THE BROWN IS DEAD	2
1254	OUR HYPOTHESIS THREE WAS THAT THE WHITE SUBSTANCE FOUND AT THE PERIMETER OF THE YEAST SAMPLE WAS NOT YEAST BUT RATHER A WASTE PRODUCT PRODUCED BY THE LIVING RED YEAST	3
1255	OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RED AND WHITE CELLS ARE LIVING ARE WELL SUPPORTED BY OUR DATA IN OUR LAB	2
1256	OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT THE YEAST TURNS WHITE WHEN PLACED IN CONTACT WITH NUTRIENTS AND TURNS RED WHEN DEPRIVED OF NUTRIENTS	3
1257	OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT WHITE YEAST CELLS GROW FASTER THAN RED YEAST CELLS OUR INVESTIGATIONS WITH NUTRIENT STRONGLY SUPPORTED THIS HYPOTHESIS IN OUR ONLY WHITE SAMPLE AFTER ONE WEEK IT WAS STILL ONLY WHITE BUT MORE OF IT IN OUR ONLY RED SAMPLE THERE WAS A LITTLE RED IN THE CENTER WITH WHITE AROUND THE OUTER EDGE MORE WHITE PRESENT THAN RED OUR RED AND WHITE SAMPLE HAD THE SAME RESULTS AS THE ONLY RED SAMPLE THEREFORE IN THIS NUTRIENT WHITE IS GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN RED HOWEVER IN NUTRIENT WE HAD THE OPPOSITE RESULTS THEREFORE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT THIS HYPOTHESIS	3
1258	OUR SECOND HYPOTHESIS DURING THE WEEK ONE PORTION OF THE LAB WAS THAT ONLY THE WHITE YEAST WAS LIVING WOULD GROW AND THE RED YEAST WAS DEAD WOULD NOT GROW	3
1259	OVER TIME WHITE WILL TURN RED	3
1260	OVERCROWDING WITH RED CELLS IN THE MIDDLE GIVES NO ROOM FOR WHITE CELLS TO BUD THEREFORE STICK ON OUTER RING OF RED	2
1261	OVERTIME THE YEAST UNDERGOES A CHEMICAL CHANGE RESULTING IN A COLOR CHANGE WITH THIS COLOR CHANGE THE RATE OF MULTIPLICATION CHANGES AS A RESULT RED WILL GROW FASTER THAN THE WHITE	2

1406	THE AGAR ON THE BOTTOM OF THE YEAST SAMPLE IS SOMEHOW DEFICIENT MAKING A SANDWICH SHOULD KEEP YEAST COLOR UNIFORM EITHER RED OR WHITE DEPENDING ON AGAR TYPE	2
1407	THE AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS AFFECTS RATE OF GROWTH	2
1408	THE AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS AVAILABLE AFFECTS THE COLOR OF THE YEAST AND THE RATE OF GROWTH THE WHITE YEAST CELLS HAVE OBTAINED FULL NUTRIENTS AND GROW FASTER THAN THE RED CELLS WHICH ARE LACKING IN SOME IMPORTANT NUTRIENT	3
1409	THE CENTER OF THE YEAST PATCH IS PHOBIC THE EDGE IS PHILIC	3
1410	THE COLOR OF THE YEAST IS BASED ON NUTRIENTS THE RED PART OF THE YEAST IS RED BECAUSE IT LACKS ADEQUATE NUTRIENTS IF YEAST IS DEPRIVED OF NUTRIENTS THE RED WILL REMAIN RED AND THE WHITE WILL BECOME RED IT WILL STILL GROW BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IF IT WOULD HAD IT RECEIVED ENOUGH NUTRIENTS WHEN THE YEAST HAS A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS IT BECOMES OR REMAINS WHITE IT WILL ALSO FLOURISH	3
1411	THE DARKER RED CAN GROW FASTER THAN THE LIGHT RED	0
1412	THE DEVELOPMENT OF YEAST IT BEGINS WITH THE WHITE AND CONTINUES TO BE WHITE UNTIL THE NUTRIENTS ARE DRAINED AND THE YEAST WITH THE LACK OF NUTRIENTS TURNS RED	4
1413	THE DIFFERENCE IN THE COLOR OF THE YEAST IS DUE TO ADEQUATE NUTRIENTS THE YEAST WILL GROW IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS BUT MORE IN THE ONE WITH ENOUGH NUTRIENTS THE RED YEAST IS CAUSED BY THE LACK OF NUTRIENTS THE WHITE YEAST HAS ENOUGH NUTRIENTS IT WILL TURN RED ONCE THE NUTRIENTS HAS DIMINISHED OR WHEN THERE IS THE LACK OF NUTRIENTS	3
1414	THE DIFFERENT COLORS ARE AN OPTICAL EFFECT DUE TO THE DENSITY OF THE YEAST	1
1415	THE DIFFERENT COLORS ARE AN OPTICAL EFFECT DUE TO THE DENSITY OF THE YEAST	1
1416	THE EDGE OF THE PATCH IS NOT BUDDING YET WHILE THE CENTER IS ALREADY BUDDED	3
1417	THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESIS WAS WELL SUPPORTED BY THE DATE WE HAVE COLLECTED HYPOTHESIS THE LACK OF NUTRITION CAUSES YEAST TO TURN RED EXPLANATIONS DURING ITS GROW YEAST IS WHITE SINCE IT HAVE PLENTY OF NUTRIENTS BUT AS THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS COMES TO AN END YEAST REACHES A CERTAIN SIZE AND THE SUPPLY OF NUTRIENTS BECOMES SLIM IT DETERIORATES AND DIES BUT IT IS STILL NORMALLY DEVELOPED ON THE EDGES BECAUSE THE DETERIORATION PROCESS STARTS IN THE MIDDLE BUT IT IS STILL ENOUGH NUTRITION TO SUPPORT THE THIN LAYER OF YEAST ON THE EDGE	4
1418	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOOSE IS MY SECOND HYPOTHESIS I CAME UP WITH FOR THIS EXPERIMENT THE HYPOTHESIS STATED RED YEAST CELLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLONY ABSORB MORE NUTRIENTS I FEEL THAT I NOW STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS HYPOTHESIS I DO HOWEVER BELIEVE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE NOW THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS DONE ORIGINALLY I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE RED CELLS TOOK IN MORE NUTRIENTS AS I SAID ABOVE BUT IN MY EXPERIMENTS THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THE OPPOSITE IT DIDNT MATTER IF I USED WHITE OR RED CELLS THE ENDING RESULT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME IT ALSO DIDNT MATTER IF I USED NUTRIENT POOR OR RICH AGAR THE ENDING RESULTS WERE STILL THE SAME I NOTICED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS AS THE YEAST GREW NEW CELLS BY BUDDING THAT THE RED CELLS WERE ACTUALLY GETTING FURTHER AWAY FROM THE AGAR WHICH CONTAINED THE NUTRIENTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CELLS BUD IN ALL DIRECTIONS I NOTICED WHITE CELLS ON THE BOTTOM TOUCHING THE AGAR AND ALL AROUND THE EDGES THERE WERE NO RED CELLS IN THOSE AREAS ONLY IN THE MIDDLE ON THE TOP ALSO ON ONE PETRI DISH WE STUCK THE CELLS BOTH RED IN ONE AREA AND WHITE IN ANOTHER INTO THE AGAR AND THE RESULT WAS WHITE CELL	2
1419	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOOSE IS THAT WHITE MUTATES TO RED ACCORDING TO THIS HYPOTHESIS IF I ONLY PUT THE WHITE YEAST ONLY INTO THE FRESH PETRI DISH I WOULD ONLY SEE BOTH WHITE AND RED IN THE PETRI DISH AFTER SEVEN DAYS	3
1420	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOOSE IS WHITE ACTS AS A DEFENSE MEMBRANE TO PROTECT FOR THE RED	2
1421	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOSE AS WELL SUPPORTED WAS THAT THE RED YEAST IS POOR IN NUTRIENTS AND THE WHITE YEAST IS RICH IN NUTRIENTS THAT IS THAT THE WHITE YEAST TURNS RED WHEN IT RUNS OUT OF NUTRIENTS	3
1422	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOSE IS FROM GROUP THE RED YEAST MUTATES INTO WHITE YEAST THE WHITE YEAST IS GETTING READY TO BUD THIS MEANS THAT THE A MUTATION OCCURS WITH THE YEASTS IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE RED YEAST IS GOING TO MUTATE CHANGE INTO THE WHITE YEAST THE WHITE YEAST IS GETTING READY TO BUD GROW MORE WHITE YEASTS	3
1423	THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOSE THAT OUR GROUP INVESTIGATED WAS THAT WHITE WILL GROW INTO WHITE BUT AFTER TIME IT WILL TURN INTO RED	3
1424	THE HYPOTHESIS I FEEL IS THE MOST SUPPORTED WAS THE WHITE YEAST SURROUNDS THE RED YEAST DUE TO ITS NATURE	0
1425	THE HYPOTHESIS I FEEL WAS WELL SUPPORTED WAS THAT THE WHITE YEAST WILL REPRODUCE WHEREAS THE RED YEAST WILL NOT	3
1426	THE HYPOTHESIS I HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCUSS IN MY LAB IS THAT BOTH WHITE AND RED YEAST CELLS ARE LIVING	2
1427	THE HYPOTHESIS IS AS FOLLOWS BOTH THE RED AND WHITE PIGMENTED SECTIONS OF THE YEAST ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT ORGANISMS THAT EACH REQUIRE DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS TO GROW THE PREDICTION IS THAT THE RED PIGMENTED SECTION WILL GROW IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE NUTRIENT AND THE WHITE PIGMENTED SECTION WILL GROW IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFERENT NUTRIENT THE NUTRIENT THAT MAKES THE WHITE PIGMENT GROW WILL NOT MAKE THE RED PIGMENT GROW AND VICE VERSA	3
1428	THE HYPOTHESIS IS RED IS DYING AND WHITE IS ALIVE THE RED PART OF THE YEAST IS OLDER THAN THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST THE COLOR OF THE YEAST DETERMINES THE OLDER BUDS FROM THE YOUNGER BUDS AS THE BUDS MULTIPLY THE OLDER ONES CHANGE COLOR RED	3
1429	THE HYPOTHESIS MY GROUP CHOSE WAS AN ALL WHITE SAMPLE OF YEAST WILL GROW ALL WHITE BUT AFTER TIME WILL TURN ALL RED	3
1430	THE HYPOTHESIS OUR EXPERIMENT WAS BEST DESIGNED FOR WAS THAT THE RED PORTION OF THE YEAST WAS THE OLDER MORE MATURE PORTION OF THE ORGANISM THE WHITE WAS THE YOUNGER	3
1431	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DEFICIENCY OF NUTRIENTS MAKES THE YEAST TURNING RED WAS WELL SUPPORTED BY MY COLLECTED DATA IN THE YEAST LAB WHEN YEAST GROWING THE YEAST EDGE THAT STILL CONTACTS WITH THE PLATE YEAST HAVE ENOUGH NUTRIENT NEED IS WHITE THE YEAST CENTER DOES NOT CONTACT WITH THE PLATE YEAST HAVE NOT ENOUGH NUTRIENT NEED IS RED EVEN THE WHITE YEAST THAT GROWS IN THE DEFICIENT NUTRIENT PLATE APPEARS MOSTLY RED AND A LITTLE PINKISH ON WHICH CONTACT WITH AGAR HOWEVER THE RED YEAST THAT GROWS IN THE MEDIUM NUTRIENT PLATE APPEARS MOSTLY WHITE EDGE AND RED CENTER FROM THOSE DATA I AM ABLE TO MAKE A CONCLUSION THAT DEFICIENCY OF NUTRIENTS MAKES THE YEAST TURNING RED	4
1432	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I BELIEVE IS WELL SUPPORTED IN OUR EXPERIMENT IS RED YEAST IN THE CENTER OF THE YEAST COLONY ARE POOR NUTRIENT AND WHITE YEASTS AT THE EDGE ARE RICH IN NUTRIENTS AS WE KNOW YEASTS BY NATURE DO NOT MOVE BY THEMSELVES AND THEREFORE THE ONLY POSSIBLE MOVEMENT THEY HAVE IS THE DIVISION AND EXPANSION OF THE YEAST COLONY BECAUSE OF THIS FACT A YEAST COLONY THAT IS GROWING ON NUTRIENT PLATE WILL DEVELOP A CERTAIN PATTERN THOSE YEASTS THAT ARE LOCATED AT THE EDGE WHERE THERE IS NUTRIENT GROW WHITE AND THOSE WHO ARE IN THE CENTER GROW RED	3
1433	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I CHOSE TO DESCRIBE IS MY GROUPS HYPOTHESIS THREE FROM WEEK TWO THAT HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT WHITE SERVES AS A PROTECTOR TO THE RED MEANING THAT IN EITHER CASE OF WHAT EVER MIXTURE WE USE ONLY WHITE ONLY RED OR A MIXTURE WHITE WOULD SERVES ITS PURPOSE AS THE PROTECTOR	2
1434	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I CHOSE TO DISCUSS IS THAT THE WHITE SECTION OF THE YEAST IS A MUTATION OF THE RED THIS HYPOTHESIS IS LOGICAL BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF MANY POSSIBLE SCENARIOS THAT CAN OCCUR IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS TO SEE IF THIS REACTION CAUSES A DIFFERENCE IN THE YEASTS PHYSICAL MAKEUP	3
1435	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL IS STRONGLY CONTRADICTED BY THE DATA THAT WE COLLECTED IS RED IS GROWING AND WHITE IS NOT	3
1436	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL IS WELL SUPPORTED IS THE RED CELLS ARE NUTRIENT POOR THE WHITE CELLS ARE NUTRIENT RICH LACK OF NUTRIENTS WILL TURN WHITE TO RED	3
1437	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL IS WELL SUPPORTED IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WHITE CELLS ARE ACTIVE	1
1438	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL IT STRONGLY CONTRADICTED ACCORDING TO THE DATA I HAVE COLLECTED THAT IS I BELIEVED THAT THE WHITE YEAST PART ACTS AS DEFENSE MEMBRANE TO PROTECT THE RED PART	2
1439	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FEEL WAS WELL SUPPORTED BY THE DATA THAT I HAVE COLLECTED IS RED YEAST IS ALIVE WHITE YEAST GROWS FROM IT	2
1440	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I FELT WAS WELL SUPPORTED BY OUR DATA WAS THAT THE WHITE YEAST CELLS SERVED AS A DEFENSE MEMBRANE TO THE RED YEAST CELLS	2
1441	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I HAD SELECTED WAS THAT THE RED YEAST IS OLD AND LOW IN NUTRIENTS AND GROWS SLOWER WHILE THE WHITE YEAST IS YOUNG AND RICH IN NUTRIENTS	3
1442	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I HAVE CHOSEN STATES THAT IF THE CELLS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE RED AND WHITE YEAST CELL GROWTH ARE DEAD AND THE CELLS ON THE INSIDE OF THE CELL GROWTH ARE ALIVE THEN THE WHITE CELLS HAVE DIED AND THE RED CELLS ARE STILL ALIVE	3
1443	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCUSS IN MY LAB IS THAT WHITE YEAST CELLS ARE IMMATURE AND RED YEAST CELLS ARE MATURE THAT IS ALL CELLS START OUT WHITE AND EVENTUALLY TURN RED AS THEY AGE AND MATURE OVER TIME	3
1444	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I THINK IS THE MOST WELL SUPPORTED THAT WE COLLECTED IS IF THE YEAST IS LACKING COMPONENT OF NUTRIENTS THEN THE WHITE PART WILL NOT APPEAR	2
1445	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IS WELL SUPPORTED DURING THE LAB EXPERIMENT WAS THAT THE WHITE WAS NEW YEAST AND THE RED WAS OLD YEAST	3
1446	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WE CHOSE FOR EXPERIMENT THREE STATED THAT THE WHITE EXTERIOR OF THE YEAST GOT ENOUGH NUTRIENTS WHILE THE RED CENTER DID NOT CAUSING ITS APPEARANCE	3
1447	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WELL SUPPORTED THE DATA WOULD BE WHITE GROWS AROUND RED YEAST	2
1448	THE HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT IF WHITE WAS APPLIED ON THE TOP OF THE RED YEAST THEN THE WHITE WOULD BECOME THE CENTER OF THE BACTERIA AND THE RED WILL BECOME THE OUTER EDGE	2
1449	THE HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST GETS ENOUGH NUTRIENTS AND THAT THE RED PART IS MALNOURISHED	3
1450	THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH I CHOSE TO DO IS HYPOTHESIS THREE IT WAS THAT THE WHITE YEAST IS A DEFENSE MEMBRANE FOR THE RED YEAST MY GROUP DID FIVE EXPERIMENTS FOUR OUT THE FIVE EXPERIMENTS STRONGLY SUPPORTED OUR HYPOTHESIS	2
1451	THE INSIDE MAYBE RED BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE YEAST IS REPLICATING THE WHITE MAYBE LEFT OVER	2
1452	THE MORE NUTRIENTS THE MORE THE YEAST WOULD GROW	2
1453	THE NUTRIENTS ARE SOAKED UP BY THE OUTSIDE WHITE CELLS BY THE TIME THEY REACH THE INNER CELLS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH NUTRIENTS FOR THE RED CELLS	3
1454	THE ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS THAT WE FAVORED WAS THAT THE RED WAS THE GROWING LIVING YEAST AND THAT THE WHITE WAS A BYPRODUCT OF THE YEASTS RESPIRATION	3
1455	THE OUTER EDGE IS AT A MORE ACTIVE BUDDING IS WHITE LIFE STATE WHERE AS THE RED IS STILL ALIVE BUT NO LONGER BUDDING DUE TO LACK LF NUTRIENTS	3
1456	THE OUTER EDGE IS AT A MORE ACTIVE BUDDING IS WHITE LIFE STATE	2
1457	THE OUTER EDGE OF THE YEAST CELL IS THE GROWING AND LIVING PART OF THE CELL THE RED SPOTS ON THE INSIDE OF THE YEAST ARE DISCOLORED IN COMPARISON TO THE WHITE BECAUSE THE RED SPOTS ARE DYING OR STARVED CELLS	3
1458	THE OUTER WHITE SHELL SERVES AS BARRIER THAT NEEDED FOR REPRODUCTION	2
1459	THE OUTER WHITE YEAST SERVES AS A BARRIER FOR THE RED YEAST	2
1460	THE OUTSIDE BORDER OF THE YEAST SAMPLE IS WHITE BECAUSE IT IS NUTRIENT ENRICHED WHILE THE CENTER OF THE YEAST SAMPLE IS RED BECAUSE IT IS NUTRIENT DEPRIVED THEREFORE THE WHITE YEAST SAMPLE WILL ONLY GROW WHITE IN FULL NUTRIENTS AND WILL TURN RED IN INSUFFICIENT NUTRIENTS LIKEWISE THE RED YEAST SAMPLE WILL TURN WHITE IN FULL NUTRIENTS AND REMAIN RED IN INSUFFICIENT NUTRIENTS	3
1461	THE RED CELLS ARE LIKE A FETUS AND THE WHITE CELLS ARE PROTECTING THEM WHILE THEY GROW	3
1462	THE RED CENTER IS PHOBIC THE WHITE PART IS PHILIC	3
1463	THE RED CENTER IS THE BUILDUP OF THE YEASTS WASTE PRODUCTS	2
1464	THE RED COLORATION IS BIOLOGICAL WASTE	2
1465	THE RED COLORATION IS BIOLOGICAL WASTE	2
1466	THE RED IS DOMINANT TO WHITE	3
1467	THE RED IS GETTING MORE NUTRIENTS THAN THE WHITE ONE	3
1468	THE RED IS GROWING AND THE WHITE PART IS NOT	3
1469	THE RED IS LACKS OF NUTRIENT AND WHITE IS NUTRIENT RICH	3
1470	THE RED IS NOT DEAD YEAST BUT IT IS JUST A WASTE MATERIAL	2
1471	THE RED IS RED BECAUSE IT LACKS NUTRIENTS	2
1472	THE RED NEEDS LESS NUTRIENTS THAN WHITE	3
1473	THE RED PART IS DEAD	2
1474	THE RED PART IS STILL ACTIVELY GROWING WHILE THE WHITE EDGES IS DONE AND DRIED UP IF YOU STOPPED FEEDING THE YEAST NUTRIENTS AND LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE IT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN WHITE	3
1475	THE RED PART OF THE YEAST IS DEAD AND THE WHITE PART IS ALIVE AND GROWING	3
1476	THE RED YEAST CELLS ARE LIVING AND THE WHITE YEAST CELLS ARE DEAD	3
1477	THE RED YEAST FEEDS FASTER THAN THE WHITE YEAST	3
1478	THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD	3
1479	THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD THE WHITE YEAST USED UP ALL THE SURROUNDING NUTRIENTS	3
1480	THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD THIS HYPOTHESIS SUGGEST THAT IF YOU TAKE THE WHITE YEAST AND SEPARATE IT FROM THE RED YEAST IT WILL NOT GROW BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALIVE	3
1481	THE RED YEAST IS DEAD	2
1482	THE RED YEAST IS DEAD BECAUSE THE RED IS DEAD IS SHOULDNT GROW	2
1483	THE RED YEAST IS DEVELOPING AND THE WHITE YEAST IS PROTECTING	1
1484	THE RED YEAST IS GROWING SLOWER THAN THE WHITE YEAST	3
1485	THE RED YEAST IS HEALTHIER THAN THE WHITE ONES	1
1486	THE RED YEAST IS IN A LESS ACTIVE DORMANT STATE WHILE THE WHITE YEAST IS IN A MORE ACTIVE BUDDING STATE	3
1487	THE RED YEAST IS MORE MATURE THAN THE WHITE YEAST	3
1488	THE RED YEAST IS RICH IN NUTRIENT THE WHITE LACKS NUTRIENT	3
1489	THE RED YEAST NEEDS THE WHITE YEAST TO SURVIVE BUT THE WHITE YEAST DOESNT NEED THE RED YEAST TO SURVIVE IN OTHER WORDS THE RED YEAST WONT GROW WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE WHITE YEAST BUT THE WHITE YEAST WILL GROW WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE RED YEAST	3
1490	THE RED YEAST ON DEFICIENT AGAR WILL FLOURISH	2
1491	THE RED YEAST WILL NOT REPRODUCE BECAUSE IT IS DEAD	2
1492	THE RED YEAST WOULD GROW MORE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE NUTRIENTS	2
1493	THE TEMPERATE MAKES THE YEAST RED OR WHITE HOT MAKES RED AND COLD MAKES WHITE	3
1494	THE TWO VARIETIES OF YEAST RED AND WHITE ARE BOTH LIVING ORGANISMS THAT DIFFER IN COLOR BASED ON EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN NUTRIENT SIMPLY PUT RED YEAST IS NUTRIENT STARVED AND WHITE YEAST IS NUTRIENT ENRICHED	3
1495	THE TYPE OF NUTRIENTS DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE COLOR OF THE YEAST	2
1496	THE WHITE AREA IS THE RECEPTOR OF THE NUTRIENTS	1
1497	THE WHITE AREA OF THE YEAST ABSORBS THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE RED AREA THIS IS THE HYPOTHESIS I CHOSE TO SUPPORT MY DATA THIS HYPOTHESIS COULD POSSIBLY MEAN THAT THE WHITE YEAST IS THE NEW GROWING YEAST WHILE THE RED IS THE OLDER AND STILL ALIVE	3
1498	THE WHITE CELLS ARE A WASTE PRODUCT OF THE ACTIVE RED CELLS THEREFORE THE WHITE CELLS WILL NOT GROW WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE RED CELLS	2
1499	THE WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD	2

1513	THE WHITE EDGE SURROUNDING THE RED YEAST IS A BYPRODUCT OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION WASTE	2
1514	THE WHITE EDGES ARE THE BUDSNEW GROWTH GROWING FROM THE RED CENTER	2
1515	THE WHITE EDGES OF THE YEAST ARE PROTECTIVE SHIELDS THAT COLLECT AND PASS NUTRIENTS THROUGH THE WHITE BARRIER TO THE RED CENTER OF THE YEAST THE RED CELLS BUD AND TURN RED BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUSTENANCE THE WHITE CELLS ARE WHITE BECAUSE THEY ARE STARVING FROM PASSING ALL NUTRIENTS TO THE RED CENTER THE WHITE RING OF CELLS ALWAYS FORMS AROUND THE RED CENTER CELLS	4
1516	THE WHITE GROWS FIRST THEN THE RED BEGINS TO GROW	3
1517	THE WHITE IS A BYPRODUCT MAYBE YEAST AND WATER MAYBE ITS THE WASTE PRODUCT OF ALL YEAST CELLS THEY ARE NOT YEAST	2
1518	THE WHITE IS DERIVED FROM THE RED SO WILL RED TURN WHITE	2
1519	THE WHITE IS DOMINANT TO RED	3
1520	THE WHITE IS IN PROCESS OF GROWING AND THE RED HAS ALREADY GROWN	3
1521	THE WHITE IS NEW AND HAS NOT FULLY GROWN YET AND THE RED IS FULLY GROWN AND IS OLD	3
1522	THE WHITE IS NEW AND HAS NOT FULLY GROWN YET THE RED IS FULLY GROWN AND IS OLD RED WILL NOT GROW FURTHER	3
1523	THE WHITE IS NEWLY BUDDED CELLS THE RED HAS NOT BUDDED YET	3
1524	THE WHITE IS NOT YEAST IT IS A BYPRODUCT	2
1525	THE WHITE LAYER PART OF THE YEAST IS THE PROTECTIVE SKIN FOR THE RED PART	2
1526	THE WHITE OUTER EDGE IS AT A MORE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE BUDDING LIFE STATE DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF NUTRIENTS	2
1527	THE WHITE OUTER EDGE IS AT A MORE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE BUDDING LIFE STATE	2
1528	THE WHITE PART IS A DEFENSIVE MEMBRANE PRODUCED TO PROTECT THE RED YEAST IN THE MIDDLE	2
1529	THE WHITE PART IS ALIVE AND IT GROWS UP FAST AND IN DIFFERENT LAYERS THICKER THE RED PART IS GROWING OLDER OR EVEN DYING OF LACK OF NUTRIENTS AS THE YEAST USES ONLY THE SURFACE OF THE NUTRIENT MEDIUM THE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE RED PART IS VERY SMALL OR EVEN NOTHING	3
1530	THE WHITE PART IS DEAD AND THE RED PART IS ALIVE USING UP NUTRIENTS AND PUSHING THE WASTE TO THE EDGE	3
1531	THE WHITE PART IS DOMINANT OVER THE RED THEREFORE WHITE ONLY GROW OUT TO BE WHITE AND RED ALSO TO GROWS TO BE PART RED AND WHITE	1

1533	THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST BACTERIA IS DEAD AND THE RED PART IS FULL OF NUTRIENTS AND STILL ALIVE	3
1534	THE WHITE PART OF THE YEAST CELLS GROW AT A FASTER PACE THAN THE RED PART OF THE YEAST CELLS	3
1535	THE WHITE RING IS THE ACTIVE YEAST AND THE RED PART IS NOT AS ACTIVE	1
1536	THE WHITE YEAST CELLS ARE RECEIVING NUTRIENTS AND THE RED YEAST CELLS ARE RECEIVING LITTLE OR NO NUTRIENTS I BELIEVE THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS IS WELL SUPPORTED	3
1537	THE WHITE YEAST HAVE OBTAINED ENOUGH NUTRIENTS AND THE RED ONES DID NOT	3
1538	THE WHITE YEAST HAVE OBTAINED ENOUGH NUTRIENTS AND THE RED ONES DID NOT	3
1539	THE WHITE YEAST IS A LIVE	2
1540	THE WHITE YEAST IS ALIVE AND BUDDING AND THE RED YEAST IS NOT	3
1541	THE WHITE YEAST IS ALIVE AND BUDDING THE RED YEAST IS NOT	3
1542	THE WHITE YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE RED YEAST IS DEAD	3
1543	THE WHITE YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE RED YEAST IS DEAD THE RED YEAST USED UP ALL THE SURROUNDING NUTRIENTS	3
1544	THE WHITE YEAST IS ALIVE WHILE THE RED YEAST IS DEAD	3
1545	THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD AND THE RED PORTION IS ALIVE AND GROWING USING UP NUTRIENTS AND PUSHING THE WASTE TO THE EDGE CREATING THE WHITE RING	3
1546	THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD BUT THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE	3
1547	THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE	3
1548	THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD WHILE THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE	3
1549	THE WHITE YEAST IS FROM DEAD CELLS	1
1550	THE WHITE YEAST IS IN PROCESS OF GROWING AND THE RED YEAST HAS ALREADY GROWN	3
1551	THE WHITE YEAST IS PROTECTIVE MEMBRANE	2
1552	THE WHITE YEAST NEED A NUTRIENT RICH ENVIRONMENT TO FLOURISH AND GROW	2
1553	THE WHITE YEAST NEEDS NUTRIENT RICH ENVIRONMENT TO FLOURISH IN ORDER FOR THE WHITE YEAST TO LIVE AND GROW ITS NEEDS FULL NUTRIENTS	2
1554	THE WHITE YEAST ON THE OUTSIDE ARE BUDS WHICH REPRESENT ACTIVE OR LIVING YEAST RED YEAST HAS GONE THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE AND IS NO LONGER LIVING	3
1555	THE WHITE YEAST RICH IN NUTRIENT RED YEAST LACKS NUTRIENT	3
1556	THE WHITE YEAST WILL REPRODUCE ONLY WHITE YEAST IF GIVEN AMPLE NOURISHMENT AND ROOM	2
1557	THE YEAST ARE ONE ORGANISM WITH TWO ALLELES FOR THE GENE DETERMINING COLOR THE DOMINANT TRAIT IS WHITE THE RECESSIVE TRAIT IS RED	3
1558	THE YEAST CHANGES COLOR BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS	2
1559	THE YEAST DEVELOPMENT IS NUTRIENT BASED	1
1560	THE YEAST GROWS BETTER IN COMPLETE DARKNESS	2
1561	THE YEAST GROWS BETTER IN THE ORIGINAL OVER THE SPECIAL NUTRIENT	2
1562	THE YEAST IN THE CENTER OBTAINED ENOUGH NUTRIENTS AND TURNED RED AS THEY MULTIPLIED THE NUTRIENTS RAN OUT AND YEAST ON THE EDGE WERE WHITE DUE TO LACK OF NUTRIENTS	4
1563	THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STRAINS OF YEAST PRESENT A RED STRAIN AND A WHITE STRAIN	3
1564	THERE IS A SPECIFIC NUTRIENT IN THE COMPLETE NUTRIENT PLATE THAT MAKES THE YEAST GROW	2
1565	THERE IS ONE STRAIN OF YEAST IF A PART OF THE STRAIN OF YEAST LOSES ACCESS TO NUTRIENTS IT WILL TURN RED THE REST WILL BE WHITE	3
1566	THERE IS ONE STRAIN OF YEAST IF CELLS ARE STILL REPRODUCING THEY WILL BE A WHITE COLOR ONCE THEY DIE AND STOP REPRODUCING THEY WILL TURN RED	3
1567	TO SEE IF RED IS LIVING AND WHITE IS DEAD	3
1568	TO SEE IF RED IS YOUNGER AND WHITE IS OLDER	3
1569	TO SEE IF THE RED OR WHITE PARTS OF THE YEAST HAS BUDDING CELLS	2
1570	TURNS RED DYING WHEN IT RUNS OUT OF NUTRIENTS	2
1571	WE CHOOSE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WHITE IS NEED MORE NUTRIENT THAN RED IN OTHER WORD RED IS NEED LESS NUTRIENT THAN WHITE AS A GROUP WE FORE TELL THE RESULTS IS IN A REGULAR AGAR WE GET MORE WHITE AND IN A LESS NUTRIENT AGAR WE GET MORE RED	3
1572	WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE WHITE PORTION OF THE YEAST WAS DEAD YEAST WHILE THE RED PORTION OF IT WAS REPRODUCING ALIVE YEAST WE MADE THIS ASSUMPTION BECAUSE WE SAW A LARGE AREA WITH SPARSE RED YEAST AND A MORE DENSE THIN OUTER PERIMETER OF WHITE YEAST THEREFORE WE CONCLUDED THAT THE RED YEAST WAS BEING VERY ACTIVE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE WHITE YEAST COULD BE DEAD AND BEING PILED UP OUTSIDE WITH NO REPRODUCTION	3
1573	WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE RED YEAST BECAME RED BECAUSE IT WAS STARVED OF NUTRIENTS WE THOUGHT THAT THE WHITE WAS WHITE BECAUSE IT HAD ENOUGH NUTRIENTS	3
1574	WE PREDICTED THE RED YEAST WAS DEAD THEREFORE THERE WOULD BE NO GROWTH ON THE PLATES WITH RED YEAST AND NORMAL AGAR WE BELIEVED THE RED YEAST IS DEAD BECAUSE THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT ROOM FOR BUDDING AND THE NUTRIENTS HAVE BEEN USED UP IN THIS PART OF THE AGAR	2
1575	WE THOUGHT THAT THE RED YEAST WAS ALIVE AND THE WHITE YEAST WAS DEAD AND THAT THE WHITE YEAST WAS BEING PUSHED AWAY FROM THE RED YEAST THUSLY WE DECIDED THAT IF WE SEPARATED THE RED YEAST OUT IT WOULD GROW	3
1576	WEEK TWO HYPOTHESIS THREE WHITE IS DOMINATE TO RED I FEEL IS STRONGLY CONTRADICTED BY THE DATA THAT MY LAB COLLECTED	3
1577	WHATEVER IS MISSING FROM THE LESS NUTRITIOUS AGAR IS WHAT CAUSES THE YEAST TO TURN WHITE IN THE REGULAR AGAR	2
1578	WHEN LOOKING AT WHITE YEAST THAT CONTAINED A TOP LAYER OF RED YEAST ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT WE MADE FOR THE REASON OF THIS APPEARANCE WAS THAT THE RED YEAST IS ALIVE AND THE WHITE YEAST IS DEAD	3
1579	WHEN RED YEAST IS SURROUNDED IN THREE DIMENSIONS BY NUTRIENTS IT WILL TURN WHITE AND GROW IN ALL DIRECTIONS	2
1580	WHEN THE RED DIE IT TURNS TO WHITE	3
1581	WHENEVER THE RED YEAST IS DEVELOPING THE WHITE YEAST MUST BE ON THE EDGES TO PROTECT THE RED YEAST THE RED YEAST MUST GROW WITH THE WHITE YEAST ON THE EDGES	2
1582	WHITE ABSORBS NUTRIENTS FOR RED	2
1583	WHITE ACT AS DEFENSE MEMBRANE TO PROTECT RED	2
1584	WHITE ACTS AS DEFENSE MEMBRANE TO PROTECT RED	2
1585	WHITE ALONE WILL NOT PRODUCE RED	2

1606	WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD AND ARE THEREFORE NOT BUDDING	2
1607	WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD AND RED CELLS ALIVE	3
1608	WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD AND RED CELLS ALIVE HYPOTHESIS CONTRADICTED THIS HYPOTHESIS IS CONTRADICTED BECAUSE OF THE DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED IN BOTH OF THE EXPERIMENTS IN EACH CASE THERE WAS MORE GROWTH OF THE WHITE YEAST THAN THE RED	3
1609	WHITE CELLS ARE DEAD CELLS RED CELLS ARE ALIVE	3
1610	WHITE CELLS ARE FORMED BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDING WHEN OVERCROWDING OCCURS CELLS IN THE CENTER STAY RED BECAUSE THEY ARE BUDDING THE OTHER CELLS ARE NOT BUDDING BECAUSE OF THEY ARE BEING CROWDED OUT PUSHED TO THE EDGES AND THEN TURN WHITE AND STOP BUDDING	3
1611	WHITE CELLS ARE GROWING MORE RAPIDLY THAN RED CELLS	3
1612	WHITE CELLS ARE INACTIVE DUE TO A LACK OF NUTRIENT WHILE RED CELLS ARE STILL ACTIVE WHITE CELLS WILL TURN RED WHEN REINTRODUCED TO NEW SUPPLY OF NUTRIENT	1

1614	WHITE CELLS ARE NEW GROWTH RED CELLS ARE OLDER GENERATION	3
1615	WHITE CELLS ARE OLD CELLS RED CELLS ARE YOUNG	3
1616	WHITE CELLS ARE WHITE DUE TO STARVATION OF NUTRIENTS RED CELLS ARE RED BECAUSE THEY ARE THRIVING ALIVE FROM NUTRIENTS WHITE IS A PROTECTIVE SHIELD FOR RED PASSES NUTRIENTS WHITE RING ALWAYS FORMS	3
1617	WHITE CELLS GROW MORE RAPIDLY THAN RED CELLS	3
