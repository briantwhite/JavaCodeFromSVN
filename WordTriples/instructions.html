<h1>Instructions for using Word Triples</h1>
Word triples is a Java application designed to pre-process text files
containing short text documents for machine-learning algorithms.  
It starts with a text file containing many "hypotheses" - short 
text documents that have been scored on a nominal scale.  These are
then pre-processed into ARFF files so that they can be used to train a 
machine-learning or data mining algorithm.
<br>
Specifically, WordTriples does the following:
<ol>
  <li>Finds all the unique WORDS in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Counts the frequency with which they appear in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to group words into synonym groups and to exclude certain
      words from the analysis.</li>
  <li>Scores each of the hypotheses by the presence or absence of the SINGLE
      WORDS and outputs the results as an ARFF file.</li>
  <li>Prepares a list of all the possible two-word combinations of the
      word set and counts their frequency of occurrance in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to exclude word pairs below a certain frequency of 
      occurrance.</li>
  <li>Scores each of the hypotheses by the presence or absence of the WORD PAIRS
      and outputs the results as an ARFF file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use Word Triples</h2>
The process consists of the following steps.  
Each will be described in detail below.
The results from certain steps can be saved to a file and these files
can be used to re-enter the process at certain points.  These are noted below.
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the hypothesis file.</li>
  <li>Open the hypothesis file in WordTriples</li>
  <li>View the hypotheses that have been loaded.</li>
  <li>Find the set of different words in the hypothesis set
      and count the frequency with which they appear.</li>
  <li>Group words into synonym groups.</li>
  <li>Exclude words from the analysis.</li>
  <li>Assign numerical codes for each word. <b>The results of this 
      intermediate step can be saved to a WORDSET file.</b>
  <li>Score each hypothesis by the occurrance of each word in the word set.</li>
  <li>Optionally re-code the nominal scores of each hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Save the single word scores to an ARFF file.</li>
  <li>Find all the possible word pairs from the word set and count how often
      each of them appears in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Exclude from the analysis the word pairs that occur less freqently
      than a cutoff value.  <b>The results of this intermediate step can be
      saved to a WORDPAIR file.</b></li>
  <li>Score each hypothesis by the occurrance of each word pair in the word
      pair set.</li>
  <li>Optionally re-code the nominal scores of each hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Save the word pair scores as an ARFF file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Each of these steps is described in detail below:</h3>
<b>(1) Prepare the hypothesis file.</b>  Hypothesis files have the following format 
and can be prepared using Word or other text editor:
<ul>
  <li>One line per hypothesis</li>
  <li>All text in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS</li>
  <li>Each word separated by one space only</li>
  <li>No numbers or punctuation</li>
  <li>Each consists of three fields, separated by TABS:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A serial number to identify the hypothesis.</li>
      <li>The hypothesis (not surrounded by quotes).</li>
      <li>The score assigned to the hypothesis by previous (usually human)
          scorers.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
A few sample lines are shown below:
<pre>
0	I THINK THAT AS THE YEAST CONTINUES TO EXPAND THE EDGES WILL ALSO BECOME RED	2
1	HOW MANY YEAST CAN BE SUSTAINED IN ONE PETRI DISH	0
2	UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DOES THE YEAST GROW BEST	0
3	THE WHITE CELLS LACKS OXYGEN RED CELLS HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF OXYGEN	3
4	WHITE CELLS GOT CONTAMINATED FROM THE AIR	2
5	WHITE CELLS ARE IMMATURE CELLS AND RED CELLS ARE MATURE	3
</pre>

<b>(2) Open the hypothesis file in WordTriples.</b>
<ol>
  <li>Launch WordTriples</li>
  <li>Go to Pane (0)</li>
  <li>Select the hypothesis file</li>
  <li>Switch to pane 1 and the file is automatically loaded.</li>
</ol>

<b>(3) View the hypotheses that have been loaded.</b>
<br>
You will now see a table containing your hypotheses.  
<br>Some notes:
<ul>
  <li>The first column is the serial number for each hypothesis.</li>
  <li>The second column is the hypothesis text.</li>
  <li>The third column is the score that was assigned to the hypothesis.</li>
  <li>You can sort the contents of the table by the contents any of the columns
      by clicking on the cell at the top of each row. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The first click sorts in ascending order; you will see a little triangle
          pointing up in the top cell.</li>
      <li>The second click sorts in descending order; you will see a little triangle
          pointing down in the top cell.</li>
      <li>The third click restores the order that the table started with; the little
          triangle disappears.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>You should sort by the hypothesis text and scroll through for hypotheses
      that start with spaces or quotes or contain punctuation, etc.  If you
      find these, quit WordTriples and open the hypotheses file in a word processor,
      and fix the offending hypotheses. It may take several rounds of inspection
      to fix all the hypotheses.  When all the hypotheses are fixed, proceed to
      the next step.</li>
</ul>

<b>(4) Find the set of different words in the hypothesis set
      and count the frequency with which they appear.</b><br>
Click on Pane (2) and you will see a table with 4 columns; the data in the table
can be sorted based on any of the columns as in the previous step.
<ol>
  <li><b>Word</b> this lists the words the program found in the set of hypotheses.
      You should scan through this for inappropriate words (words with punctuation,
      numbers, etc.).  You should fix the offending hypotheses in a word procesor.
      You will almost certainly find several "words" that show up
      only as a blank.  These are the result of one or more adjacent spaces in a
      hypotheses.  If you find this, you should close WordTriples, open the hypotheses
      file in a word processor, and replace all double-spaces with single spaces.  You 
      should repeat this "replace all" until it no-longer finds any double spaces.
      You should then use WordTriples to check that all the words are OK.</li>
<li><b>Count</b> this shows how many times each word appeared in the set of
     hypotheses. You eill see that most words appear only a few times.</li>
<li><b>Group</b> this is the word group that each word will be assigned to.  These
     will be blank at the start.  You will fill them in at the next step.</li>
<li><b>Code</b> this is the numerical code that will be assigned to each word.
     These all start at 0.  In later steps in the program, these codes will be
     used to represent each word or word group for analysis.</li>
</ol>

<b>(5) Group words into synonym groups.</b> <br>
At this step, you assign a numerical code to each word.  This code can be unique or
can be shared by several words.  There are three main reasons why words should
share a code:
<ul>
  <li>The words are synonyms.  In this case, you should enter a letter
      to serve as a group code for all the words in a given group.  You can
      use any letter (case matters), but don't use group letter Z (see
      later).  You should use a different letter for each group.  All words
      with the same group letter will be assigned the same code.</li>
  <li>The words are mis-spelled variants of the same word.  You should assign
      spelling variants of the same word to the same group.</li>
  <li>The words are <i>don't care words</i></li>.  
    <ul>
      <li>In single-word analysis, these are words where you don't care whether they
        are in the hypothesis or not.  Usually, these are words that occur in only
        a very small number of hypotheses. You should assign them to group Z - you
        can use the "Set at or below cutoff to group Z" buttonand choose an appropriate
        cutoff.  Any words that occur at or below the cutoff number will be
        assigned to group Z.  These will be ignored in later analysis.</li>
      <li>In multiple-word analysis, these are words where you don't care which
        word they are.  Usually, these are words that occur in only
        a very small number of hypotheses. You should assign them to group Z - you
        can use the "Set at or below cutoff to group Z" buttonand choose an appropriate
        cutoff.  Any words that occur at or below the cutoff number will be
        assigned to group Z.  These will be treated as a generic word in later analysis.</li>
    </ul>
 </ul>
you can save the results of this step to a file.
