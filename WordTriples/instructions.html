<h1>Instructions for using Word Triples</h1>
Word triples is a Java application designed to pre-process text files
containing short text documents for machine-learning algorithms.  
It starts with a text file containing many "hypotheses" - short 
text documents that have been scored on a nominal scale.  These are
then pre-processed into ARFF files so that they can be used to train a 
machine-learning or data mining algorithm.
<br>
Specifically, WordTriples does the following:
<ol>
  <li>Finds all the unique WORDS in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Counts the frequency with which they appear in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to group words into synonym groups and to exclude certain
      words from the analysis.</li>
  <li>Scores each of the hypotheses by the presence or absence of the SINGLE
      WORDS and outputs the results as an ARFF file.</li>
  <li>Prepares a list of all the possible two-word combinations of the
      word set and counts their frequency of occurrance in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to exclude word pairs below a certain frequency of 
      occurrance.</li>
  <li>Scores each of the hypotheses by the presence or absence of the WORD PAIRS
      and outputs the results as an ARFF file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use Word Triples</h2>
The process consists of the following steps.  
Each will be described in detail below.
The results from certain steps can be saved to a file and these files
can be used to re-enter the process at certain points.  These are noted below.
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the hypothesis file.</li>
  <li>Open the hypothesis file in WordTriples</li>
  <li>View the hypotheses that have been loaded.</li>
  <li>Find the set of different words in the hypothesis set
      and count the frequency with which they appear.</li>
  <li>Group words into synonym groups.</li>
  <li>Exclude words from the analysis.</li>
  <li>Assign numerical codes for each word. <b>The results of this 
      intermediate step can be saved to a WORDSET file.</b>
  <li>Score each hypothesis by the occurrance of each word in the word set.</li>
  <li>Optionally re-code the nominal scores of each hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Save the single word scores to an ARFF file.</li>
  <li>Find all the possible word pairs from the word set and count how often
      each of them appears in the hypothesis set.</li>
  <li>Exclude from the analysis the word pairs that occur less freqently
      than a cutoff value.  <b>The results of this intermediate step can be
      saved to a WORDPAIR file.</b></li>
  <li>Score each hypothesis by the occurrance of each word pair in the word
      pair set.</li>
  <li>Optionally re-code the nominal scores of each hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Save the word pair scores as an ARFF file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Each of these steps is described in detail below:</h3>
<b>(1) Prepare the hypothesis file.</b>  Hypothesis files have the following format 
and can be prepared using Word or other text editor:
<ul>
  <li>One line per hypothesis</li>
  <li>All text in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS</li>
  <li>Each word separated by one space only</li>
  <li>No numbers or punctuation</li>
  <li>Each consists of three fields, separated by TABS:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A serial number to identify the hypothesis.</li>
      <li>The hypothesis (not surrounded by quotes).</li>
      <li>The score assigned to the hypothesis by previous (usually human)
          scorers.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<b>(2) Open the hypothesis file in WordTriples.</b>
