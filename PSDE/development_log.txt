started development
this will be a combo of the PSDE for the OrgoGame and a place to run problem sets on a desktop

found java cell phone emulator code at http://www.microemu.org/index.html
got version 2.0.3 (2008-12-15)
   got both the jar and the sources

try to get them into jar
   make folder resources/
   put the microemulator.jar into resources/
   be sure it gets back in when loaded from cvs
   in Properties, make it a jar
   seems to work - eclipse finds the class
   BUT - once in jar, it can't find the class
   the microemu.jar is in the jar
   	 but how do you get the program to find it?
   
   maybe punt and just put the source files in...
   
try a lib/ folder
  put the source there
  

sigh, will need to put the source stuff in a package in src
and will need to get some libraries
	got the SWT library from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/eclipse.php
	followed directions
		added as project and as project in build path
	also needed org.objectweb.asm library
		here had to add as archive folder into the src/ directory
	also needed netscape.javascript.JSObject
		had to add external jar /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/plugin.jar

works, but when you quit the emulator, since it uses System.exit(0)
	it kills the whole program!

need to make my own version of the org.microemu.app.Main
	that is what I want...
