started developing with the genotype-phenotype map
start that with a pathway

							|--(enz 1)--> 2 --(enz 2)--> 3
	molec 0 --(enz 0)--> 1 -|
	        				|--(enz 3)--> 4 --(enz 4)--> 5 --(enz 5)--> 6
	        				
recursive tracing seems to be working

made simple GUI for playing

----------------------------
BIG PICTURE

works in phases

1) it generates ~20 mutants randomly in the genes - single mutants
	make sure that all are hit at least once

2) presents them in complementation test table 20x20
	user selects medium for complementation test and it shows table of +, -
	user can drag columns of table to make nice groups (it looks like this is built into tables)
	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JTable.html says "By default, 
	columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the view's columns appear in a different 
	order to the columns in the model."

3) user selects certain mutants to put in "working set"
	can edit this set

4) go to pathway where you can make a multiple mutant and see which media is grows on
	(like the current toy version) 
	where the mutants in the working set are the choices
	
5) mapping?
