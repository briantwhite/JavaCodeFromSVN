started developing with the genotype-phenotype map
start that with a pathway

							|--(enz 1)--> 2 --(enz 2)--> 3
	molec 0 --(enz 0)--> 1 -|
	        				|--(enz 3)--> 4 --(enz 4)--> 5 --(enz 5)--> 6
	        				
recursive tracing seems to be working
but need to build in how the enzyme inactivity is modeled.
