Features Log:
History List:
- double-click to get menu of options
	to upper
	to lower
	add notes
	delete
	
Greenhouse in general:
	- can change names of .organism files in greenhouse folder
		next time they are loaded, the name in the greenhouse
		will match the filename (that way, you can re-name
		them after you've saved them).

Molecular Biology:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into 
		gene expression panels
	- "save" folds proteins as necessary if they aren't already 
		before saving


Biochemistry:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into
		folding windows
	- can't save proteins to greenhouse (DNA siquence is unclear)

Genetics:
	- single click an organism in greenhouse or genetics window
	    to toggle selection
	- mutate hits BOTH copies once and only once
		(3/4 chance of mutation; 1/4 chance that it is "changed" to same

Work Log:

9/25/06
started from scratch
added in protex and genex
had to modify them so they made JPanels rather than JFrames
  since you can't add a JFrame to a JTabbedPane
  
9/27/06
worked on genex
- made it a 2-panel version
- parallel structure to protex
- nuked out printing, and black-and-white stuff
- nuked help and about

9/28/06 
working on genex
- trying to get folding button to work

12/6/06
added stuff for aligning sequences
got code from http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/bsa/bsapplet.html
it was in one big file & therefore hard to use
broke into individual class files
use them like new NM(new BloSum50(), 8, seq1, seq2).domatch(new Output(), "message");

3/1?/07
added class molGenexp/CustomListSelectionModel
start of trying to make selections work better
this one just reports out the updating events

3/14/07
- made Green-1 (homozygous green) organism

in case organism gets messed up, the DNA sequences are:
 Green-1

 also altered CustomListSelectionModel
 - commented out the print statements

***SAVED AS VERSION 0.8
-this version works
	- it has the ugly selection thing
	- it does not print debug messages to the console
 
- working on improved genetics selection management
-removed "location" integer from Organism (not needed since now in OrgAndLoc class)
	had to do lots of fixes
- got the genetics selection to work
- the double-click in genex & protex makes a HUGE list of errors...

3/16/07
- got it to work
 you need to make a new CustomListSelectionModel when switching panes
 otherwise you get the infininte loop of calls to setSelectedIndexes()
 - this is because the old object keeps some state info that needs to be cleared out
 	therefore, making a new one is the best way to clear it out

- fixed it so that any changes to greenhouse clears oal1 and oal2

3/27/07
bug: paste a sequence into genex & express it
	it folds the "previous" sequence, not the new one.

- fixed in GeneExpressionWindow - in load new sequence button listener
	use the instance variable currentGene (was a local variable)

used this to make the greenhouse of organisms shown on 3/14/07

bug: after adding to greenhouse from genex, the "add" button is disabled
fixed

6/15/07
bug: when resized, the aa table in protex can shrink vertically
fixed: added box layout and rigid vertical area

major refactoring
made superclasses of major types:

- Workbench = GeneticsWorkbench, protex, and genex 
	the big thing with both panels and the controls

- Workpanel = an individual window for a tray, folding one protein, one gene

- HistoryList = a generic history list

- HistListItem = a generic member of history list (eg a Tray)

implemented these for genetics first.

got proteins to work - but it broke 
	- the organisms in the greenhouse (need to remake)
	- the comparator (check the name of the class it looks for)

6/17/07
continued working
had to remake greenhouse
- working on comparator bug...
need to put in mge and SequenceComparatorMenuItemListener
to look for class biochem.BiochemistryWorkbench

now OK

implement refactoring and double-click hist list items for genex

NOTE!!! - the DNA hist list used to allow you to double-click to show the folded protein
now, we'll need to nuke this feature or make a special menu item....

this was the code:
			public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
				if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
					ExpressedGene eg = 
						(ExpressedGene)getSelectedValue();
					FoldedPolypeptide fp = eg.getFoldedPolypeptide();
					JLabel colorChipForDialog = new JLabel("     ");
					colorChipForDialog.setOpaque(true);
					colorChipForDialog.setBackground(fp.getColor());
					colorChipForDialog.setBorder(new LineBorder(Color.BLACK));

					Object[] options = {"OK",
							new JLabel("Color:"),
							colorChipForDialog
					};
					JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(
							mge,
							"",
							"Protein Structure",
							JOptionPane.YES_OPTION,
							JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE,
							fp.getFullSizePic(),
							options,
							options[0]);
				}
			}

6/19/07
- tried to fix genex bug: when you select a base off screen, it scrools back to show the first base
 scrollRectToVisible should work, but it doesn't...
 
 - refactoring:
 	- fix references to genex and protex to MolBiolWorkbench and BiochemistryWorkbench
 
 - fixed the HistListPopupMenu for mol bio to show the protein structure
 
 added a new allele: a white that produces no protein.
 this makes a new greenhouse set (red is not a heterozygote of red and white-null)
 
 the sequences are:
 Green-1

changed orange to be 255,100,0 - to be more conspicuously different from yellow and red

called it version 1.1

6/20/07
BIG TROUBLE
while the program opens the greenhouse fine in eclipse
the "serial versions" don't match when you run it from the command line or double-clicking the jar
the jvm's are different....
how to fix this?

tried removing the serialVersionUID from Organism.java (that's the only place it appears)
NG

try getting latest java...
NG

note that the errors are always the same - even when I change Organism.java
java.io.InvalidClassException: javax.swing.ImageIcon$AccessibleImageIcon; local class incompatible: 
   stream classdesc serialVersionUID = -3994512798706967451, local class serialVersionUID = -1903458698681874148
   
forget it
just save Organisms as DNA seqences 
	one per line
	it will ignore any line that doesn't contain all AGCT
read them in and assemble them as they come in
have a progress bar for this.

this should be version 1.2
set version # and made a version in CVS

made mac and pc versions
in mac version, used JarBundler to make a .app
	right-click the .app
	"view contents"
	use bbedit to open Info.plist
	add:
		<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
        <string>edu.umb.MGX</string>
	now, this will act like a real application in the "restricted finder" list of applications

7/6/07
apply fixes from protex
1) improved speed
put in CVS

2) changed color coding of amino acids in biochem workshop

made version 1.3
put in cvs
tagged as version 1.3

set so that the greenhouse won't get wider if you stretch the whole thing

version 1.3.1
put in cvs
tagged as version 1.3.1

10/5/07
- it was crashing when people had more than 60 trays in the Genetics Workshop
due to OutOfMemoryError
(more info in notebook)
In Organism.java, was creating these massive int[] for each BufferedImage of the flower icon
could not get them garbage collected
- they were 500kb per tray!
so made a static iconCache in Organism to keep the icons we've made so far
  (indexed by color.toString())
now there are no more of these massive arrays
should be OK
try making many trays
made 100 & it was OK
tagged as version 1.3.2

10/18/07
working on new bug
if you make a lot of mutants, it runs out of memory
it's because of all the buffered images
therefore, when making mutants, don't make the images
- save the new organisms with the images as NULL
- if you open them in biochemworkbench, then draw the picx as necessary

started refactoring GridCanvas's paint() to allow for multiple entry points
