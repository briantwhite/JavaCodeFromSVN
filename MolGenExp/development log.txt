Features Log:

Greenhouse in general:
	- can change names of .organism files in greenhouse folder
		next time they are loaded, the name in the greenhouse
		will match the filename (that way, you can re-name
		them after you've saved them).

Molecular Biology:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into 
		gene expression panels
	- "save" folds proteins as necessary if they aren't already 
		before saving


Biochemistry:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into
		folding windows
	- can't save proteins to greenhouse (DNA siquence is unclear)

Genetics:
	- single click an organism in greenhouse or genetics window
	    to toggle selection

started from scratch
added in protex and genex
had to modify them so they made JPanels rather than JFrames
  since you can't add a JFrame to a JTabbedPane
  
9/27/06
worked on genex
- made it a 2-panel version
- parallel structure to protex
- nuked out printing, and black-and-white stuff
- nuked help and about

9/28/06 
working on genex
- trying to get folding button to work
