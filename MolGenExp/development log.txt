Features Log:

Greenhouse in general:
	- can change names of .organism files in greenhouse folder
		next time they are loaded, the name in the greenhouse
		will match the filename (that way, you can re-name
		them after you've saved them).

Molecular Biology:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into 
		gene expression panels
	- "save" folds proteins as necessary if they aren't already 
		before saving


Biochemistry:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into
		folding windows
	- can't save proteins to greenhouse (DNA siquence is unclear)

Genetics:
	- single click an organism in greenhouse or genetics window
	    to toggle selection
	- mutate hits BOTH copies once and only once
		(3/4 chance of mutation; 1/4 chance that it is "changed" to same

Work Log:

9/25/06
started from scratch
added in protex and genex
had to modify them so they made JPanels rather than JFrames
  since you can't add a JFrame to a JTabbedPane
  
9/27/06
worked on genex
- made it a 2-panel version
- parallel structure to protex
- nuked out printing, and black-and-white stuff
- nuked help and about

9/28/06 
working on genex
- trying to get folding button to work

12/6/06
added stuff for aligning sequences
got code from http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/bsa/bsapplet.html
it was in one big file & therefore hard to use
broke into individual class files
use them like new NM(new BloSum50(), 8, seq1, seq2).domatch(new Output(), "message");
