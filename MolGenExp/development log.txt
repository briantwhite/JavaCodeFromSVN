Features Log:

Greenhouse in general:
	- can change names of .organism files in greenhouse folder
		next time they are loaded, the name in the greenhouse
		will match the filename (that way, you can re-name
		them after you've saved them).

Molecular Biology:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into 
		gene expression panels
	- "save" folds proteins as necessary if they aren't already 
		before saving


Biochemistry:
	- double-click on greenhouse member loads it into
		folding windows
	- can't save proteins to greenhouse (DNA siquence is unclear)

Genetics:
	- single click an organism in greenhouse or genetics window
	    to toggle selection
	- mutate hits BOTH copies once and only once
		(3/4 chance of mutation; 1/4 chance that it is "changed" to same

Work Log:

9/25/06
started from scratch
added in protex and genex
had to modify them so they made JPanels rather than JFrames
  since you can't add a JFrame to a JTabbedPane
  
9/27/06
worked on genex
- made it a 2-panel version
- parallel structure to protex
- nuked out printing, and black-and-white stuff
- nuked help and about

9/28/06 
working on genex
- trying to get folding button to work

12/6/06
added stuff for aligning sequences
got code from http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/bsa/bsapplet.html
it was in one big file & therefore hard to use
broke into individual class files
use them like new NM(new BloSum50(), 8, seq1, seq2).domatch(new Output(), "message");

3/1?/07
added class molGenexp/CustomListSelectionModel
start of trying to make selections work better
this one just reports out the updating events

3/14/07
- made Green-1 (homozygous green) organism

in case organism gets messed up, the DNA sequences are:
 Green-1

 also altered CustomListSelectionModel
 - commented out the print statements

***SAVED AS VERSION 0.8
-this version works
	- it has the ugly selection thing
	- it does not print debug messages to the console
 
- working on improved genetics selection management
-removed "location" integer from Organism (not needed since now in OrgAndLoc class)
	had to do lots of fixes
- got the genetics selection to work
- the double-click in genex & protex makes a HUGE list of errors...

3/16/07
- got it to work
 you need to make a new CustomListSelectionModel when switching panes
 otherwise you get the infininte loop of calls to setSelectedIndexes()
 - this is because the old object keeps some state info that needs to be cleared out
 	therefore, making a new one is the best way to clear it out

- fixed it so that any changes to greenhouse clears oal1 and oal2

3/27/07
bug: paste a sequence into genex & express it
	it folds the "previous" sequence, not the new one.

- fixed in GeneExpressionWindow - in load new sequence button listener
	use the instance variable currentGene (was a local variable)

used this to make the greenhouse of organisms shown on 3/14/07

bug: after adding to greenhouse from genex, the "add" button is disabled
fixed

6/15/07
bug: when resized, the aa table in protex can shrink vertically
fixed: added box layout and rigid vertical area
