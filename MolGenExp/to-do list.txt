need to fix:
	- adding notes to one of the features doesn't work
	
	
Julie Noor suggests a more complex Aipotu

2 genes - unlinked
each organism gets 2 sets of 2 DNA sequences

Have one or more alternative phenotypes
	? +/- or levels?
		if levels, copy # can count (if both genes are fungal resistance)
	fungal resistance
	drought tolerance
	herbivore resistance (nasty tasting protein)
	nutrient scavenging ability
	light gathering ability
	seed dispersal
	
	- need structure-phenotype mappings
	- need additions to icons to show these phenos

Not fitness sliders in evolution, but "environment settings"
	pollinator preference
	herbivores, etc

UI changes
	genetics & greenhouse & evolution - modify pix to show other phenos
	biochem & mobo - tabs "gene 1" and "gene 2"

need a way to turn off or hide the second gene
