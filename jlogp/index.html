<h3><center>jlogP: a Hydrophobicity and Molecular Formula Calculator Applet</h3></center>
JlogP is a java applet the calculates two important properties of small molecules:
<ul>
  <li><u>Molecular Formula</u>: the number of atoms of each element present in the 
         molecule as well as the molecule's overall charge.</li>
  <li><u>Hydrophobicity</u> expressed as logP: this is the calucalted logarithm of 
         the octanol/water partition coefficient of the molecule.  The higher the
         logP, the more hydrophobic the molecule. <font color=red>Note that the
         logP values calculated by jlogP are <i>very approximate</i>.  They
         are intended for teaching purposes only and not for research or
         development.</font>  See below for other, professional-grade logP
         calculation programs.</li>
</ul>

JlogP requres that the molecule's structure be submitted in three different 
formats simultaneously: SMILES, jme, and MDL molfile</a>.  These three input 
formats are most easily provided by 
<a href="http://www.molinspiration.com/jme/getjme.html">JME: the Java Molecule Editor</a> 
applet.  JME is a very user-friendly molecular drawing applet that can be used in a 
wide variety of web-based applications. Peter Ertl, the author
of JME has generously made the JME applet available for free; see the 
<a href="http://">JME website</a> for details.  A sample page using jlogP and JME can
be found <a href="test.html">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
You can create your own custom jlogp-JME website based on this <a href="test.html">sample
page</a> or use it as is.  See below for instructions.
<hr>
<b><u>System Requirements</b></u><br>
JlogP requires the latest version of the Java Virtual Machine (jvm); this is available
for <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/manual.html" target="_blank">free</a> 
for most platforms (Windows 98 and above; UNIX/Linux; Mac OS X); 
it is not possible to run jlogP on Mac Classic (OS 9.2 or lower).

  <li><a href="jlogp.tar.gz">A .tar.gz archive of jlogp and a sample website that 
      uses jlogP</a>.  Note that you will have to obtain 
      <a href="www.molinspiration.com/jme/getjme.html">jme</a> separately
      in order to set up your own jlogP-JME website. <font color=red>Note: if you teach
      a class using jogP, you are <i>strongly</i> advised to set up your own website 
      for the following reasons</font>:
      <ul>
        <li>You may want to customize the web page to your class.</li>
        <li>I may update my site without warning.</li>
        <li>My server may be down without warning.</li>
      </ul>
      To set up your own jlogP-JME website, you should:
      <ol>
        <li>Obtain <a href="www.molinspiration.com/jme/getjme.html">JME</a>
            from Peter Ertl.</li>
        <li>Download and un-compress the archive described above.</li>
        <li>Put all three files (jlogp.jar, JME.jar, and test.html) in the <u>same
            directory</u> on your web server.</li>
        <li>Make a link to test.html on your course website.</li>
      </ol></li>
  <li><a href="jlogp_Source.tar.gz">A .tar.gz archive of the JlogP Source Code</a>.
      This is only useful if you want to modify jlogP and compile it yourself.  There
      are three files in this archive:
      <ul>
        <li><b>jlogp.java</b>: the jlogp applet itself.  This contains the code that
            determines the hybridization, aromaticity, and neighbors of each atom
            in the molecule as well as calculating the formula and overall logP.</li>
        <li><b>Atom.java</b>: an individual atom. This contains the code that categorizes
            the atom into one of the 90+ types.</li>
        <li><b>AtomSpec.java</b>: this is a data-carrying object that is passed from
            Atom to jlogp.</li>
     </ul>
     You can build your own version of jlogP as follows (I'd appreciate if you let me know
     the changes you make so that I might be able to use them myself):
     <ol>
       <li>Download and un-compress the source files described above into a
           specific directory.  Do all the remaining steps in this directory.</li>
       <li>Modify them as needed.</li>
       <li>Compile them (for this, you'll need a java compiler): 
           <code>javac jlogp.java Atom.java AtomSpec.java</code></li>
       <li>Put them in a jar-file: <code>jar -cvf jlogp.java *.java </code></li>
       <li>Move jlogp.jar into the proper directory on your web server.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ul>

<b><u>Hydrophobicity Calculations: The details</b></u>:<br>
This software has been developed for use in teaching <a href="http://intro.bio.umb.edu/111-112/">
Introductory Biology</a> at the college level. As a result, it lacks some of the features 
of similar tools that have been developed for professionals.  The important features
and limitations of jlogP are listed below:
<ul>
  <li><b>Allowed structures</b>: Structures using C, N, H, O, P, S, and the halogens are allowed
      with the following limitations (jlogP will issue a warning if you attempt to calculate
      the properties of an 'illegal' structure):
      <ul>
        <li>Carbon atoms can make only 4 covalent bonds and cannot be charged.</li>
        <li>Nitrogen atoms can make 3 or 4 covalent bonds (except in the case of NO<sub>2</sub>
            where they can make 5 covalent bonds); nitrogens can be (+)-charged;
            (-)-charged N's are not allowed.</li>
        <li>Oxygen atoms can make 1 or 2 covalent bonds; oxygens can be (-)-charged but not 
            (+)-charged.</li>
        <li>Sulfur atoms can make 2 covalent bonds (or 6 as in a SO<sub>2</sub> group); they
            cannot be charged.</li>
        <li>Phosphorus atoms can make 5 covalent bonds only (as in a PO<sub>4</sub> group).
            </li> 
      </ul></li>
  <li><b>logP calculation method</b>: jlogP uses a modified version of the atom-additive
      methods used by Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.</i> <b>1997</b>,
      <i>37</i>, 615-21 and <i>Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design</i> <b>2000</b>:
      <i>19</i>, 47-66) in their xlogp software.  Briefly, both programs categorize each
      atom in the molecule into one of 90+ types based on the element, its hybridization,
      and its neighbors.  Each type has a characteristic contribution to the overall logP
      of the molecule.  xlogP sums the individual atom contributions and applies 10 correction
      factors that take larger scale effects into account. jlogp 1.1 does not apply these
      correction factors; future versions may.
  <li><b>Charged groups</b>: The only charged groups allowed by jlogP are N+ and O-.  Because
      the logP of charged groups is highly dependent on pH, jlopP's logP estimates for
      charged molecules are <u>very approximate</u>.  
  <li><b>Other software for calculating logP</b>: there are several other programs that
      can calculate logP values; each has some advantages and disadvantages.  The table 
      below summarizes this information:
