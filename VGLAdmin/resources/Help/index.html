<p align="justify">To run VGL Admin simply double-click on the VGLAdmin.exe file.
		Note: Be sure to have the images and Help folder in the same 
		path as the VGLAdmin.exe file.<br>
		When VGL Admin launches, you will see this window:<br>

<br>
<p align="justify">You can use this feature to load up previously saved problems that you might
have been created. To open a problem you can either select "Open Problem"
from the drop-down "File" menu or simply click on the "Open Problem" button 
on the toolbar. A dialog box will open up to assist you in selecting a file. 
Browse to the directory in which the problem file is stored. Select the file 
and click on the "Open" button. VGL will read the file and will open up the 
problem and bring all the values you last left it in before you saved and 
closed the problem.

<p align="justify">You can use this feature to save your current work to a file. To save your 
work you can either select "Save" from the drop-down "File" menu or simply 
click on the "Save" button on the toolbar. A dialog box will open up to assist 
you in saving your work to a file in the directory of your choice. Browse
to the directory in which you want to save your work. In the "File Name" 
field enter the name of the file you want you want to save your work as. 
Then click on the "Save" button. This will create and save a file with the
name as specified in the field and will store your current work in it.

<p align="justify">You can set all the value back to default setting by select "Clear" from
the drop-down Edit menu or simply click on the "Clear" button on the 
toolbar. It will set the chance of simple dominance to 50, chance of autosomal 
to 50, chance of XX (male) and XY (female) to 50, uncheck the "Practice Mode"
and disable the email function.

<a name="How%20to%20set%20limits%20on%20the%20problem"><b><i>How to Set limits on the
problem:</i></b>
<br>
<p align="justify">The three sliders set the limits on the genetic models that can appear
 in a problem.  Once a problem is set, the model, phenotypes, and genotypes of the 
 starting population are generated randomly for each run.<br>
 
 	All the problems in VGL involve genetic models with one gene that has two alleles.  Based on 
	this, there are several features that can vary:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>The interaction between the alleles; this can be either:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Simple Dominance</u>: (Models 1, 3, &amp 5) The heterozygote has the same 
					phenotype as the dominant homozygote.  That is, with two alleles A and a:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>AA = tall</li>
						<li>Aa = tall</li>
						<li>aa = short</li>
					</ul>
				<li><u>Incomplete Dominance</u>: (Models 2, 4, &amp 6) The heterozygote has a 
					different phenotype than either homozygote.  In nature, this is usually 
					intermediate; in VGL it need not be.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>AA = tall</li>
							<li>Aa = medium</li>
							<li>aa = short</li>
						</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>Whether the character is sex-linked or not; this can be either:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Not sex-linked</u> - the gene for the character is carried on an autosome
					so it is inherited identically in both sexes. (Models 1 &amp 2)</li>
				<li><u>Sex-linked</u> - the gene for the character is located on a sex-chromosome
					so it is inherited differently in different sexes. This has two forms:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><u>XX/XY</u> Females are XX; males are XY (Models 3 &amp 4).
							Here, Y carries no genes except those needed to make the organism male.</li>
						<li><u>ZZ/ZW</u> Females are ZW; males are ZZ (Models 5 &amp 6).
							Here, W carries no genes except those needed to make the organism female.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>

In Practice mode, the students can choose to see the underlying genetic model and the

are learning to use the program.  In Practice mode, students can also choose not to 
see the model and genotypes by clicking a button when they open their problem.<br>
