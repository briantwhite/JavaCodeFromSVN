VGL is capable of generating much more complex problems;see <a href="#harderProblems">How can I try a different/harder problem?</a> for details.<br><br><a name="what"></a><b>What is VGL?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGL is a simulation of genetics in a hypothetical fly-like organism.  It is designed to help students learn about genetics by applying their knowledge to novel problemsituations.  Users develop their own genetic hypotheses and test them by designing, conducting,and interpreting genetic crosses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time you start a new problem in VGL, the software randomly chooses a character(for example: eye color) and two traits of that character (for example: red eyes and blue eyes).The software then chooses randomly which trait will be dominant and which will be recessive.Since the problems are generated randomly, each time you start the program the problemwill be different.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You solve the problem by determining which of the two traits is dominant and which is recessive.You do this by mating (a.k.a. crossing) pairs of creatures from the cages that VGL generates.  The results of each mating provide information to help you determine which isrecessive and which is dominant.  You can mate any male-female pair you like; it is up to youto choose the crosses and decide what they mean.  You must also decide when you have collectedenough evidence to be convinced of your answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGL can create problems involving complex modes of inheritance (sex-linkage, incompletedominance, multiple alleles, etc.); see <a href="#harderProblems">How can I try a different/harder problem?</a>  for more details.<br><br><a name="how"></a><b>How do I use VGL?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have just launched VGL, you should be seeing three things:<ul>  <li><i>These Instructions.</i></li>  <li><i>A large window entitled "Virtual Genetics Lab" with some menus and a toolbar of buttons at       at the top left.</i> This the main VGL window; the menus and buttons allow you to control      the program.</li>  <li><i>A small window marked "Cage 1".</i> This is the cage with your starting population of       creatures.</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what to do:<ol>  <li>Look at Cage 1. It will look something like this:<br>      <img src="fig1.gif"><br>      Note that, since each problem is generated randomly, your particular character,      traits, and quantities will likely be different.  This cage shows several important       facts; reading from right to left:      <ul>        <li>The character is <i>antennae</i>.</li>        <li>The two antenna traits are <i>none</i> and <i>crooked</i>.  You can click on the             small pictures to see an enlarged view.</li>        <li>There are 5 males and 3 females with no antennae; there are 7 males and 9 females             with crooked antennae.  These individuals were generated randomly, so it is not            possible to infer anything from these numbers.</li>        <li>The male and female symbols in the left-most column reprsent individual creatures            that you can choose from when designing crosses.</li>      </ul></li>  <li>Select a male creature and a female creature from Cage 1 by clicking on them.        Their symbols will become highlighted. You can choose any combination you like (this      is the beauty of VGL: you must choose your own path of investigation), it is not possible      to know <i>a priori</i> which will give you useful information and which will not.</li>  <li>Click "CROSS" button in the VGL toolbar.  VGL will then generate Cage 2 with the offspring      of the parents that you have selected.</li>  <li>Continue crossing until you have decided which trait is dominant and which is recessive.      You can choose any male from any cage and any female from any cage for your crosses.</li>  </ol><br><br><a name="genetics"></a><b>A <u>very brief</u> introduction to Genetics</b>: or, "How can I tell if it is dominantor recessive?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some important principles:<ul>  <li>Genetic characters are encoded by genes.  For example, there is one gene      for antenna shape.</li>  <li>Genes can have alternative forms called <i>alleles</i>.  Each allele corresponds      to a particular trait.  For example, there is a <i>none</i> allele of the      antenna gene and a <i>crooked</i> allele of the antenna gene.  These alleles are often      symbolized by upper- and lower-case versions of the same letter.  Typically, the       upper-case letter is used for the dominant allele and the lower-case letter for the      recessive allele.</li>  <li>Every creature has two alleles, one from its mother and one from its father.</li>  <li>Every father gives one of his alleles to each of his offspring.  Evedry mother gives      one of her alleles to each of her offspring. These alleles are chosen randomly      from the alleles that each mother and father carries.</li>  <li>The creature's appearance (its <i>phenotype</i>) depends on the particular pair of alleles      it contains (its <i>genotype</i>).  For example, suppose that the <i>none</i> allele      were dominant (symbol: "N") and the <i>crooked</i> allele were recessive (symbol: "n").      Then:       <ul>        <li>A creature with two N's ("NN") would have only <i>none</i> instructions for making            antennae, so it would have no antennae.</li>        <li>A creature with two n's ("nn") would have only <i>crooked</i> instructions for            making antennae, so it would have crooked antennae.</li>        <li>A creature with one of each allele ("Nn") has a mix of both <i>none</i> and             <i>crooked</i> information.  In this case, the result is neither intermediate            nor a random choice of either, but always that of the dominant allele.  Therefore            Nn individuals would have no antennae and have exactly the same exterior            appearance as NN individuals.</li>      </ul></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these principles, you can figure out which is dominant and which is recessive.  While some crosses are uninformative (they do not clearly distinguish between possible models), others give quite a bit of information.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you have two traits, A and B.  The following crosses giveconclusive results (you can work out the details for yourself):<ul>  <li><b>A cross A gives a mixture of A and B</b>.  This means that the "B was hiding in the       A's" - in other words, "B is recessive".</li>  <li><b>A cross B gives only A</b>.  This means that "A wins out over B" - in other words,      "B is recessive".</li></ul><br><br><a name="harderProblems"><b>How can I try a different/harder problem?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGL can generate problems with more complex genetic models.   VGL generates problems based on Problem Type Files which restrict the range ofgenetic models available.  To start a new problem of the same or increased difficulty:<ol>  <li>From the "File" menu, choose "Close work".</li>  <li>Close without saving work.</li>  <li>From the "File" menu, choose "New Problem".</li>  <li>The 10 files there specify problems of increasing levels of difficulty.       Click on the one you want and click "OK".</li>  <li>Your problem will start.</li></ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demo version of VGL automatically starts with a Level 02problem.  The chart below shows the different problem types. Note that, in "PracticeMode", you can see the underlying genetic model and the genotype of each creature; theHelp file has details (from the "Help" menu, choose "Help File".).<table border=1><tr>  <th>&nbsp;</th>  <th>&nbsp;</th>  <th colspan=4>Dominance Model</th>  <th colspan=3>Chromosomal Location</th></tr><tr>  <th>Level</th>  <th>Practice Mode</th>  <th>Simple</th>  <th>Incomplete</th>  <th>3-alleles: A>B>C</th>  <th>3-alleles: A>B; B>C; C>A</th>  <th>Autosomal</th>  <th>XX female;XY male</th>  <th>ZZ male; ZW female</th></tr><tr>  <td>1</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>2</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>3</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>4</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>5</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td></tr><tr>  <td>6</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td></tr><tr>  <td>7</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>8</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>  <td>9</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td></tr><tr>  <td>10</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td>  <td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>
