trying to fix bug
sometimes, when you enter a new DNA sequence and click on a base, nothing is selected
also, this sequence GTATAACCATGCCCTAACGGGG
gives an error when you enter it (even before you click on anything!)
     [java] Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Attempt to mutate in notification
     [java] 	at javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument.writeLock(AbstractDocument.java:1323)
     [java] 	at javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument.remove(AbstractDocument.java:570)
     [java] 	at javax.swing.JEditorPane.setText(JEditorPane.java:1493)
     [java] 	at GX.GenexGUI.refreshDisplay(GenexGUI.java:464)
something strange with the new DNA thing...

fixed it by changing from textPane.caretListener() to textPane.mouseListener() and viewToModel()

need to fix layout also

version 2.0

bug - the help does not display due to package structure issues
moved stuff around
now OK
version 2.0.1

6/25/12
fixed bugs & added features
- changed second exon color to #FF8C00 to be more visible
- moved version label to title bar
- if terminator missing, still transcribe, but go to end
- in text of problem set, change asking for a 
	“single base change”, I’d talk about “a single base substitution”, 
	otherwise you are tempted to delete/insert a base. (Sophie Javerzat)
