trying to fix bug
sometimes, when you enter a new DNA sequence and click on a base, nothing is selected
also, this sequence GTATAACCATGCCCTAACGGGG
gives an error when you enter it (even before you click on anything!)
     [java] Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Attempt to mutate in notification
     [java] 	at javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument.writeLock(AbstractDocument.java:1323)
     [java] 	at javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument.remove(AbstractDocument.java:570)
     [java] 	at javax.swing.JEditorPane.setText(JEditorPane.java:1493)
     [java] 	at GX.GenexGUI.refreshDisplay(GenexGUI.java:464)
something strange with the new DNA thing...

fixed it by changing from textPane.caretListener() to textPane.mouseListener() and viewToModel()

need to fix layout also
