<p >
	When you start the problem you are given a cage of a population of creatures collected in the 
	field. Each of these creatures will display one of two to six different <i>traits</i> 
	of one to three particular <i>characters</i> (for example, if the character is Body Color, the traits 
	might be Red Body and Green Body). Your task is to discover how these characters are inherited. 
	You determine this by <a href="#How to Cross Two Organisms">crossing</a> particular individuals 
	and observing their offspring.  You then
	use the resulting data to deduce the underlying <a href="#The Genetic Models found in VGL">
	genetic models</a> that determines the inheritance of these characters.  <font color="purple">You</font> 
	must decide when 
	you have collected enough information to be convinced that you are right - the program will 
	not tell you the right answer (except when in <a href="#Cages in Practice Mode">Practice Mode</a>).
	</p>
<p >
	When you start a new problem, VGLII randomly chooses one to three characters from a list of possible 
	characters.
	It then randomly chooses <a href="#The Genetic Models found in VGL">genetic models</a> from a list of 
	possible genetic models.  The range of possible models is be custom-configured by your 
	instructor when she creates a problem type; different problem types can have greater or
	fewer possible models and <a href="#Practice Mode">Practice Mode</a> can be enabled or disabled
	for a particular problem type. <font color="purple">Since this assignment is random, the same character
	can be inherited in different ways in different problems.</font>
	</p>
<p >
	Next, VGLII chooses particular traits of each character and assigns them randomly
	to particular genotypes.  A population of individuals with random genotypes is then generated;
	these individuals are placed in Cage 1.
	</p>
<p >
	Your task is to <a href="#How to Cross Two Organisms">cross</a> individuals from different 
	cages and observe the resulting offspring.
	From these data, you will determine the <a href="#The Genetic Models found in VGL">genetic 
	models</a> of how your particular characters are inherited.
	</p>
<br>
<a name="The Genetic Models found in VGLII"></a><font color="purple"><i>The Genetic Models found in VGL</i></font>
<br>
<p >
	All the problems in VGLII involve genetic models with genes that have either two 
	or three alleles.  Based on 
	this, there are several features that can vary:<br>
	<ul>
      <li><b>The number of alleles</b>.  This can be either:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Two alleles</u>.  In this case, there are two possible ways 
            these alleles can interact:</li>
			<ul>
			  <li><i>Simple Dominance</i>: The heterozygote has the same 
					phenotype as the dominant homozygote.  That is, with two alleles A and a:</li>
			    <ul>
				  <li>AA = tall</li>
				  <li>Aa = tall</li>
				  <li>aa = short</li>
				</ul>
			  <li><i>Incomplete Dominance</i>: The heterozygote has a 
					different phenotype than either homozygote.  In nature, this is usually 
					intermediate; in VGL it need not be.</li>
			    <ul>
				  <li>AA = tall</li>
				  <li>Aa = medium</li>
				  <li>aa = short</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
      <li><u>Three alleles</u>.  In this case, there are two different possible
        ways these alleles can interact:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Hierarchical dominance</i>:  A is dominant to B and C;
            B is dominant to C; C is reccessive to all.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>AA = green</li>
              <li>AB = green</li>
              <li>AC = green</li>
              <li>BB = red</li>
              <li>BC = red</li>
              <li>CC = blue</li>
            </ul>
          <li><i>Circular dominance</i>:  A is dominant to B;
            B is dominant to C; C is dominant to A.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>AA = green</li>
              <li>AB = green</li>
              <li>AC = blue</li>
              <li>BB = red</li>
              <li>BC = red</li>
              <li>CC = blue</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
     </ul>          
		<li><b>Whether the character is sex-linked or not</b>; this can be either:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Not sex-linked</u> - the gene for the character is carried on an autosome
					so it is inherited identically in both sexes.</li>
				<li><u>Sex-linked</u> - the gene for the character is located on a sex-chromosome
					so it is inherited differently in different sexes. This has two forms:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><i>XX/XY</i> Females are XX; males are XY.
							Here, Y carries no genes except those needed to make the organism male.</li>
						<li><i>ZZ/ZW</i> Females are ZW; males are ZZ.
							Here, W carries no genes except those needed to make the organism female.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<li><b>If genes on the same chromosome are linked or not</b>; the recombination
			       frequency can vary between 0% (completely linked) and 50% (completely unlinked).</li>
		</ul>

<p >To run VGLII simply double-click on the VGLIIx.x file.
		Note: Be sure to have the Problems folder in the same 
		folder as the VGLIIx.x file.  The toolbar buttons are shown below:

<p >When you start VGLII, you will see a toolbar like this:<br>
		<img src="fig1.jpg"><br>
		From the "File" menu, select "New Problem" or simply click on the "New Problem" button on the 
		toolbar and you will see a list of problem type files. The files are listed in increasing
		order of difficulty.  Additional problem type files can be generated using the VGLAdmin
		program.  Select the file and click on the "Open" button. 
		</p>
<p >
		 Once you start a problem, a window (Cage 1) will be opened up on the screen.  
		This cage is the starting point for your project.  The organisms can be, but are not
		necessarily, pure-breeding.

If your instructor has enabled Practice mode for a particular problem, you will be able to
see details of the &quot;answer&quot; - the genetic model for each character and the genotype
of each organism.<p>
<p >In practice mode, a cage will look like this:<br>

		before you saved and closed the problem.<br><br>

		*state - state in this context is defined as the entire collection of cages created by
		the user, including cages that were created by the user but were kept closed during the
		course of problem work. Simply stated, this means that when you open a problem, VGLII
		will display all the cages created by you up until the point you closed the problem.

<br>
<p>By selecting one or more Cages and choosing &quot;Create Summary Chart&quot; from the Utilities menu, you can 
have VGLII count the number of each type of organism found in the selected set of Cages.<p>
First, double-click on each of the cages to select them for summarization; their inner border will turn red
 to show that they are selected.  You can unselect selected cages by double-clicking on them; you 
can unselect all cages by choosing &quot;Unselect All&quot; from the Utilities menu.<p>
Once you have selected a set of Cages, choose &quot;Create Summary Chart&quot; from the Utilities menu and you
will see something like this:<p>
<img src="fig5.jpg"><br>
The top line shows that this was a summary of cages 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp; 11.<br>
These were produced from crosses of two heterozygous parents; thus, we would expect a 3:1 ratio.<br>
The observed ratio 120:26 is very close.<br>
You can choose which Characters to summarize by selecting the appropriate Characters at the top
of the window.
