rf2 (10%) = (47 + 44 + 8 + 5)/1000 = 10.4%
now, rf2 is higher
so it was probably a statistical fluke

but something strange - the sex ratios are rather skewed
and reciprocally skewed in  reciprocal classes...
shouldn't be linked (this is strictly autosomal)

also the total is not 1000
fixed bug in cage
	it was counting the first member of each phenotype twice...
try again
now getting 1000 organisms always

but still getting sex ratios that are almost 2:1
but not always...

maybe its a Random thing
put random in the constructor of ChromosomeModel
rather than making a new one each time you call getOffspring or getRandomOrg
looks better

yahoo!


6/9/08
started linking to VGL
made package VGL & put all VGL stuff there
put in /Resources
went to http://www.jdom.org/ to get jdom 1.1.tar.gz
	exploded on desktop
	cd Desktop/jdom1.1
	setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/
	./build.sh
	- it made build/jdom.jar
	- put that in VGLII
	- in VGLII properties, add Jar 
		select jdom.jar
	Now AOK!

start the migration
1) nuke all model stuff in VGL

2) in GM.organism, add stuff from VGL.organism
	- id, cageId, constructors

3) nuke VGL.organism and make VGL's refs refer to GM.organism
	- makes many bugs
		go thru & delete all stuff for reading/saving to/from files
			(didn't finish this..)

4) do same with VGL.OList and GM.OrganismList
	- add get() and find()
	
5) nuke VGL.Traits, VGL.Configuration

6) go back and finish removing the load/save stuff (for now)
   & fix bugs as you find them to make it work

nuke VGL.Genetics

6/10/08
- go thru and change all the m_fred to fred
- re-worked CageUI for new stuff
- also put in the gpl header to all classes
- reworked VGLII (nuked VGLMain and VGLMainApp)

6/12/08
- got it working in jar with pix and text only in dialogs (no pix yet)
- nuked useless phenotype pix

the jdom stuff failed as a jar...
made lib/ 
	put in stuff from VGL/lib
	in properties, add Class Folder
	edited build.xml to include lib
	- now OK

it can read in simple files!

Format: all are floats between 0 and 1 (if not specified, they default to 0)

minimal file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
	<ZZ_ZW>0.0</ZZ_ZW>
</root>

- first, set the overall sex determining mechanism
   even if not sex-linked
   
	* ZZ_ZW - chance of ZZ/ZW sex linkage

- then the first gene - there must be at least one
	* Gene1_SexLinked - chance that it'll be sex-linked
							(if not, it'll be autosomal)
	* Gene1_3Alleles - 	chance it's 3-alleles
							(if not, it'll be 2 allele)
	* Gene1_IncDom  - 	chance it's inc dom
							(if not and 2 allele - simple dom)
							(if not and 2 allele 50/50
								chance of hierarch/circ dom)
								
- second gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene2_Present -	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 1 gene model)
	* Gene2_SameChrAsGene1	- chance gene2 and 1 are on same chromo
								(if not, they are on different ones)
								(that is, sex vs auto)
	* Gene2_MinRfToGene1	- range of possible recombination freqs
	* Gene2_MaxRfToGene1		(between gene 1 and gene 2 if on same chromo)
	
	* Gene2_3Alleles		- same as above
	* Gene2_IncDom
	
- third and final gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene3_Present	- 	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 2 gene model)
	* Gene3_SameChrAsGene1	- same as above
	* Gene3_MinRfToGene1
	* Gene3_MaxRfToGene1
	* Gene3_3Alleles
	* Gene3_IncDom

sent to Peter Russell (yeast@reed.edu) & Harry Roy (royh@rpi.edu)
for testing and feedback

Harry's new problem opens in his home dir - not in Problems...

got beginner mode working

added parameter BeginnerMode (True/False)

6/16/08
- working on beginner mode:
	- have balloon help always appear in beginnerMode and show only genotype
		never show phenotype and never in non beginnerMode

- added parameters MinOffspring; MaxOffspring

renamed params
	* Gene3_MinRfToGene1 - Gene3_MinRfToPrevGene
	* Gene3_MaxRfToGene1 - Gene3_MaxRfToPrevGene
since it's linkage to either gene 2 (of 1 and 2 are linked) or to 1 (if 1 and 2 aren't)

working on summary chart
- need a way to show that a cage has been added to the selected set of cages
	for summarizing
- shift-click toggles this addition
- this is indicated by a change in background color

6/17/08
set it so that the traits are listed in random order when shown in CageUI

working on summary chart
- got it working!

6/18/08
misc fixes
- add unselect all to utilities menu
- in beginner mode "Show Genetic Model" (not "show model & genotypes")
- use scrambled phenotype order for phenotype string
	that way, it will sort properly in the CageUI
- have it deal properly when you try to make a summary chart with no
	selected cages
- tested three allele models
	needed to fix ThreeAlleleIncDom
- made all models print their descriptions nicely
- got print to file and print to printer working
- started working on save work to file

6/19/08
- more work on saving to file

6/23/08
- got saving and opening work files to work!

fixes as per e-mail from Peter Russell yeast@reed.edu
Hi Brian
    I've now had a chance to look at your beta version and think it has great promise.  
    It certainly seemed to have the same feels as GCK as one worked through a problem.   
I tried a couple of the multiple gene problems - 2 genes linked and 3 genes linked and 
can offer some comments, all of which are basically details rather than fundamental:

(1) I assume in the final, problems will be coded as in VGL1 so that the genetics 
involved is not presented?  It would also be handy, although not essential, if 
the Problems shown as options could be selected by the instructor.

(2) Problems generated phenotypes that were presented as "Normal".  If I remember 
correctly, GCK avoided that explicitly so that students would not immediately 
assume that Normal is the wild-type trait.   I suggest not using Normal as a 
phenotype but following the GCK model.  

(3) In some Problems that popped up, the same specific phenotype appeared for two 
different traits - in a specific case, Black was a phenotype for two traits in a 
three-gene mapping problem.  Obviously that is going to be confusing to students, 
or at least a complication for assigning gene symbols or discussing the problem in 
classroom presentations.  Again, I hadn't seen that happen in GCK, but encourage 
finding a way to avoiding it.

(4) The most serious issue I saw, and it is also the case with VGL1, is that 
there are not enough flies generated at times and seemingly there is no way
 to set that as a Preference.  If I recall correctly, GCK out of the blocks
  had the same issue, so we set the preferences for higher offspring populations.   
  This is particularly important for the mapping problems where we are trying to 
  instill an appreciation of statistics and accuracy, but I also see the low 
  numbers as a limitation in some of the simpler problems where in some cases 
  just a few flies appeared, and not always in both sexes, in the starting cage.  
  The latter issue adds a complication for making true-breeding populations, for 
  instance, which we'd prefer to avoid in our mixed majors-nonmajors intro bio course.

(5) In both VGL2 and 1, there is a typo in the menus -- Utilities is misspelt.

(6) On your http://intro.bio.umb.edu/vgl/ page:
    -  in the second paragraph "compatible" is misspelt. 
    - in the third paragraph, I assume "autonomic" should be "autosomal"


(I numbered them)

(1) I'll let them change the problem file names
(2) change "normal" shape to "forked"
(5) fixed
(4) had already added min and max offspring parameters; set them higher in 3-gene
    problems
(3) 2 things:
   - add a new BristleTrait to allow more options
   - set up CharSpecBank and CharSpec to prevent two color traits (etc)
   		once a colortrait is chosen, all colortraits are removed from
   		the other lists

- fixed bug in CageUI - if more than 40 offspring, it'd blow up
	it was hard-coded to 2 rows of 20
	so fixed it to 2 rows of (most possible offspring of 1 pheno)/2
	
- this may lead to trouble with lots of offspring (very long cages!)
	therefore, cap min and max offspring at 100. (do in ProblemTypeSpecification)
	
- set it to save work as zip files so that they can't cheat by looking ar work file
   to see model
   
Revised parameters <NOTE LATER REVISION>
- first, set the overall sex determining mechanism
   even if not sex-linked
	* ZZ_ZW - chance of ZZ/ZW sex linkage

- then some overall issues
	* BeginnerMode - True or False - allows users to see the genetic model
					by clicking on button in field pop cage
					and see genotypes of organisms (tool tip text)
	
	* MinOffspring - minimum number produced in each cage (capped at 100)
					- actual number is randomly distributed between these
	* MaxOffspring - maximum number produced in cage (capped at 100)

- then the first gene - there must be at least one
	* Gene1_SexLinked - chance that it'll be sex-linked
							(if not, it'll be autosomal)
	* Gene1_3Alleles - 	chance it's 3-alleles
							(if not, it'll be 2 allele)
	* Gene1_IncDom  - 	chance it's inc dom
							(if not and 2 allele - simple dom)
							(if not and 2 allele 50/50
								chance of hierarch/circ dom)
								
- second gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene2_Present -	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 1 gene model)
	* Gene2_SameChrAsGene1	- chance gene2 and 1 are on same chromo
								(if not, they are on different ones)
								(that is, sex vs auto)
	* Gene2_MinRfToGene1	- range of possible recombination freqs
	* Gene2_MaxRfToGene1		(between gene 1 and gene 2 if on same chromo)
	
	* Gene2_3Alleles		- same as above
	* Gene2_IncDom
	
- third and final gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene3_Present	- 	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 2 gene model)
	* Gene3_SameChrAsGene1	- same as above
	* Gene3_MinRfToGene1
	* Gene3_MaxRfToGene1
	* Gene3_3Alleles
	* Gene3_IncDom

- fixed up help so it matches new software

- VERSION 1.0!!!

6/25/08
misc fixes

	so there's no confusion with original VGL
- put <BeginnerMode>False</BeginnerMode> in all problem files

setting up to have it work by double-clicking work and problem files to launch VGLII
- had it deal with command-line arguments of filename

renamed problem files LevelXXp.pr2 = LevelXX.pr2 with practice mode enabled

6/26/08
- set save/open work and print to file to go to Desktop
- set it to show warning dialog if you try to open a bad file

6/27/08
fixing bugs
- summary chart persists even after you close the work
	*close work and new problem should clear it out and nuke the ui
		- add to VGLII's cleanUp() method

- if you close problem, select "save" and then cancel in the file dialog
	you lose your work
	* change cleanUp() to return

- try to make the .pr2 files zipped for security
	zip Test Level01.pr2
	mv Test.zip Test.pr2
	- recode reader
	WORKS!
	
	need to cleverly zip all files individually and rename
	first, right-click each file in finder & make archive
	then delete the originals
	then trim the extension:
	ls *.zip | sed 's/\(.*\)\.zip/  & \1/' | xargs -L1 mv

Version 1.0.1

6/29/08
started making pheno images
put boolean in cageUI to show/not-show these as they are being developed
set to false for release versions until all ready

6/30 & 7/1 
working on drawing pix

7/2/08
nuked the Bristle trait - too hard to draw
added in Wing as a body part (it had been there but not added to CharSpecbank)
- now saves Wing problems properly

- reset ImageMaker's defaults on new and open problem

got it all working!

version 1.1.0

9/26/08
had screwed up cvs so that it lost jdom
	messed it up when making PhylogenySurvey

fixed it

request for new problem file: emhowe@assumption.edu

With GCK, what I like about the program is that it allows me to create dihybrid problems 
(i.e. two traits that are unlinked or linked, depending on my intention). I also like the 
flexibility of having the dihybrid problems randomized. For example, I have it set up so 
that when a student starts a dihybrid problem, he/she is presented with two traits and the 
respective phenotypes given for each of the traits. They have to solve each trait independently 
(if they are ostensibly unlinked), and the way in which the problem is set up could have either 
of the two traits randomly start as a simple dominant model, a codominant model or a 
sex-linkage model. This system allows for students to have to figure out which model is 
appropriate for solving each trait. Of course, students also must determine how genotypes 
match to phenotypes for each trait, depending on the model they propose.

made Level11-1.pr2 - same as level 11 except 50/50 chance of inc dom for each gene

          <Chromosome Id="MaternalSexChromosome" Size="0" />
          <Chromosome Id="PaternalSexChromosome" Size="0" />
        </Organism>

somehow, it got switched - maybe it's in how the work is saved & re-loaded
sometimes I use Boolean.parseBoolean(e.getAttributeValue())
sometimes I use e.getAttribute().getBooleanValue()
maybe its a strange thing there...

this may be it: in GeneticModel, I save the sex linkage type as 'XX_XYSexDetermination'
but, in WorkFileProcessor, I look for 'XX_XYSexLinkage'
and, if I use 
	e.getAttribute("XX_XYSexLinkage").getBooleanValue());
	this throws an error
	but the code I used:
		Boolean.parseBoolean(e.getAttributeValue("XX_XYSexLinkage"))
		does not 
		
so, if you save, reopen, and save again, it should mess up the sex-linkage
test:
open a level 11 problem (no way to be zz/zw)
save
	first line:
	  <GeneticModel XX_XYSexDetermination="true" 
	  BeginnerMode="false" 
	  NumberOfCharacters="2" 
	  MinOffspring="25" MaxOffspring="35">
	
reopen and save again
	first line
	  <GeneticModel XX_XYSexDetermination="false"  - NOTE NOW FALSE!!! THIS IS THE BUG!
	  BeginnerMode="false" 
	  NumberOfCharacters="2" 
	  MinOffspring="25" MaxOffspring="35">
	
fix work file processor to look for 'XX_XYSexDetermination'
test
open level 11 problem
cross once
save
	<GeneticModel XX_XYSexDetermination="true"
reopen
cross again
save
	<GeneticModel XX_XYSexDetermination="true"

it must be that Boolean.parseBoolean(e.getAttributeValue("XX_XYSexDetermination"))
	gives "false" when getAttributValue() returns null
therefore, use the safer version e.getAttribute().getBooleanValue()

now AOK!

another bug - RFs in Level12 are always identical
fixed code in WorkFileProcessor.processChromosomeModelInfo
	it was reading in and losing all but the last RF

check to be sure all work file param names match in save, read, and the file
order: GeneticModel.save(); WorkFileProcessor.processSavedModelInfo(); work.txt
- GeneticModel; GeneticModel; GeneticModel {OK}
- XX_XYSexDetermination; XX_XYSexDetermination; XX_XYSexDetermination {OK}
- BeginnerMode; BeginnerMode; BeginnerMode {OK}
- NumberOfCharacters; NumberOfCharacters; NumberOfCharacters {OK}
- MinOffspring; MinOffspring; MinOffspring {OK}
- MaxOffspring; MaxOffspring; MaxOffspring {OK}
- CharacterOrderScrambler; CharacterOrderScrambler; CharacterOrderScrambler {OK}
- Character; - not tested -; Character {OK}
- Index; Index; Index {OK}
- ChromosomeModel; ChromosomeModel; ChromosomeModel {OK}
- SexChromosome; SexChromosome; SexChromosome {OK}
- NumGenes; - not read -; NumGenes {OK}
- checked GeneModels to be sure they save the right name string {OK}
- RfToPrevious; RfToPrevious; RfToPrevious {OK}

all should be OK now

made version 1.1.1

Bug - summary chart buttons do not always respond to clicks by changing the table!
- it is throwing 
     [java] Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2
     [java] 	at GeneticModels.OrganismList.getCustomPhenotypeString(OrganismList.java:137)
     [java] 	at VGL.SummaryChartManager.calculateTotals(SummaryChartManager.java:103)
the code there is crazy - it's doing the lookup backwards:
					phenos.get(
							traitsToCount[scrambledTraitOrder[i]])
should be get(scrambledTraitOrder[traitsToCount[i]])
	fixed in 2 places in this method
changed but still not right - no more error but
	- counts are right and labels in table of counts match
	- checkbox labels in right order and they change the table but
		- the labels don't correspond to the traits they select!

changed OList - look up not by scrambled since it's the trait's index we want
	- also, need to output trait names in scrambled order
	fixed SummaryChartManager & SummaryChartUI
- seems to work

4/22/09
bug - on pc, double-clicking a Cage does not make it turn yellow...
	although it is selected (you just can't tell).

can't get the background color to change on the pc
so just change to a colored border to show selection

4/30/09
added VGL team info to the About dialog

added in code for new phenotype images
edited it for style and removed print statements
version 1.2.0

9/2/09
starting to internationalize - externalized strings from VGLII class as a test

9/9/09
make separate help directories for different languages
access them with a line in the VGL/messages.properties VGLII.HelpFileDir=Help  (or Help_fr) etc.
html files must be UTF-8 format for the accented characters to work

9/15/09
the .properties files must have unix line breaks and be ISO-8559-1
got it working
also, the menus & toolbar must not be made new each time but removeAll() works

now, need to go class-by-class to get all the other UI strings
- in package VGL:

9/19/09
oops
didn't want to change the internal names 
	if you do, you'll break the pheno drawing
	so undo most of the changes in GeneticModels

ugh
STEP 1: make it work but don't translate phenotypes
	just be sure the labels etc work
	(then, later put in the translations of the phenotype names)
CharacterSpecificationBank - many
ColorTrait
ColorTraitSet
NumberTrait
NumberTraitSet
ShapeTrait
ShapeTraitSet

STEP 2: make a Messages.translatePhenotypeName(string)
	build this in where needed - only at display
		(all the internals are in english 
			- that way, the pheno pix work)
			
build into
CageUI -ok
to get the tool tip text right in practice mode: Chromosome, Organism - OK
to get the printing right: Organism, VGLII - OK

9/22/09
oops - put ALL the code that switches noun and adjective should be in Messages
	took it out of: Organism & Chromosome

get summary chart to work - SummaryChart & SummaryChartUI - ok
get model description in practice mode to work - 
	do for each of the GeneModels
	got all 5 working

9/23/09
get CageUI's parents panel working
also phenotype images

this will be version 2.0.0

9/24/09
text to translate for the figures:
- These are the characters involved in this problem
- The numbers here indicate the number of males and females of each type
- All of the organisms here have five wings and blue eyes.
- These are the traits of each character that each type of organism displays.
- Clicking on the "Images" button for a particular type will show a picture of that type of organism like this:
- Click this button to close the image
- These indicate the organisms selected as parents for Cage 2
- These are the offspring of the parents selected in Cage 1 above:
- These indicate the parents of the offspring in Cage 2; they can be clicked on to identify them in their original Cage.
- Holding the cursor over an organism will pop up a display of its genotype:
- Click here to show/hide the details of the genetic model:

9/29/09
- fixed text size in french help (it was too big)
- added note in close cage warning that you can get this back from Utilities->Cages
- added boolean to VGLII so that it doesn't ask to save if it hasn't changed (a cross only)
	since last save
	
posted as version 2.0.0 on website

10/10/09
fixing various bugs that Sophie Javerzat found
1) When warning about closing a cage, there's an extra "?" (messages_fr_FR.propreties)
2) it is Amit Kumar not Kuma (VGLII.java)
3) fig0.gif is missing in french help (made new one)
4) html print-to-file of work don't show accents - probably a utf-8 thing
    (print regular does not have this problem) fixed to ISO-8859-1 in VGLII.java
    
10/16/09
can't find help file on pc version!
- you always use a "/" for finding files in a jar  - even if on PC!

made version 2.0.1

11/17/09
Got spanish translations from Juan-Carlos Hern�ndez-Vega

11/21/09
working on spanish translation

1/21/10
spanish is working version 2.0.2

6/8/10
working on upgrades
1) better encryption for the .wr2 files (since we may use them for graded homework)
- use XOR to a fairly long key (see http://www.stratos.me/2008/07/java-xor-encryption/)

need to set up in
	VGLII.java (for saving)
	GeneticModelFactory.readModelFromFile (for loading)
need to be backward compatable - be able to load un-encrypted (but zipped) .wr2 files from earlier versions
	maybe use the filename in the zip? it is currently called "work.txt"
	if name is "work.txt" don't decrypt
	if name is "encrypted.txt" do decrypt
		save all new work files as encrypted.txt
- all set
	it now writes all encrypted
	but can read both

6/15/10
bug - on reading in the SECOND work file, it hangs
problem found when making the VGLIIProblemFileReader

Add line 81 to WorkFileProcessor: CharacterSpecificationBank.getInstance().refreshAll();

now is AOK

7/2010
trouble in other languages that weren't supported with a .properties file
it would die since it couldn't find the right file

modify Messages so that it checks on instantiation and defaults to english
need to fix all refs from Messages.get to Messages.getInstance().get

started adding in Korean stuff from 
Se Jin Youn
Hansung Science High School
san 5, Hyeonjeo dong, Seodaemun gu
Seoul, 120-080, Republic of Korea.
email: sejin.youn@gmail.com

7/31/10
punt on Korean for now - can get it to be visible in the .properties file
	but can't get the chars to show in the menus.
move the .properties file into a folder "Future"
comment out the line in VGLII for the Korean menu item.

several people don't like Circular Dominance
	so add three parameters to the .pr2 files: 
	come into play if 3 alleles
		Gene1_CircDom
		Gene2_CircDom
		Gene3_CircDom - 
			0 = no circ dom; all hierarch dom
			0.5 = 50/50 circ/hierarch dom <DEFAULT>
			1 = all circ dom; no hierarch dom

revised params are now:
- first, set the overall sex determining mechanism
   even if not sex-linked
	* ZZ_ZW - chance of ZZ/ZW sex linkage

- then some overall issues
	* BeginnerMode - True or False - allows users to see the genetic model
					by clicking on button in field pop cage
					and see genotypes of organisms (tool tip text)
	
	* MinOffspring - minimum number produced in each cage (capped at 100)
					- actual number is randomly distributed between these
	* MaxOffspring - maximum number produced in cage (capped at 100)

- then the first gene - there must be at least one
	* Gene1_SexLinked - chance that it'll be sex-linked
							(if not, it'll be autosomal)
	* Gene1_3Alleles - 	chance it's 3-alleles
							(if not, it'll be 2 allele)
	* Gene1_IncDom  - 	chance it's inc dom
							(if not and 2 allele - simple dom)
							(if not and 3 allele then adjustable
								chance of hierarch/circ dom - see CircDom)
	* Gene1_CircDom - chance (if it's 3 allele and not inc dom) it's circ dom
							0 = no circ dom; all hierarch dom
							0.5 = 50/50 circ/hierarch dom <DEFAULT>
							1 = all circ dom; no hierarch dom
								
- second gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene2_Present -	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 1 gene model)
	* Gene2_SameChrAsGene1	- chance gene2 and 1 are on same chromo
								(if not, they are on different ones)
								(that is, sex vs auto)
	* Gene2_MinRfToGene1	- range of possible recombination freqs
	* Gene2_MaxRfToGene1		(between gene 1 and gene 2 if on same chromo)
	
	* Gene2_3Alleles		- same as above
	* Gene2_IncDom
	* Gene2_CircDom
	
- third and final gene - may or may not be there
	* Gene3_Present	- 	chance it's present
							(if not, it's a 2 gene model)
	* Gene3_SameChrAsGene1	- same as above
	* Gene3_MinRfToGene1
	* Gene3_MaxRfToGene1
	* Gene3_3Alleles
	* Gene3_IncDom
	* Gene3_CircDom

- make new problem files
  only Level07 and Level08 have any circ dom
  make Level07-nc & -nc-p versions (Gene1_CircDom = 0) so now:

also add a 
- Level05-1.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal, ZZ/ZW, or XX/XY Sex-Linked); 2 Alleles, Simple Dominance
p versions have practice mode

- Level01.pr2 = One Autosomal Gene; 2 Alleles, Simple Dominance 
- Level02.pr2 = One Autosomal Gene; 2 Alleles, Incomplete Dominance
- Level03.pr2 = One XX/XY Sex-linked Gene; 2 Alleles, Simple Dominance
- Level04.pr2 = One XX/XY Sex-linked Gene; 2 Alleles, Incomplete Dominance
- Level05.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal or XX/XY Sex-Linked); 2 Alleles, Simple Dominance
- Level05-1.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal, XX/XY or ZZ/Zw Sex-linked); 2 Alleles, Simple Dominance
- Level06.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal or XX/XY Sex-Linked); 2 Alleles, Incomplete Dominance
- Level07.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal or XX/XY Sex-Linked); 3 Alleles 
								(Incomplete, Hierarchical, or Circular dominance)
- Level07-nc.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal or XX/XY Sex-Linked); 3 Alleles 
								(Incomplete or Hierarchical dominance)
- Level08.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal, XX/XY Sex-Linked, ZZ/ZW Sex-Linked);
				(2 or 3 Alleles); (Incomplete, Hierarchical, or Circular dominance)
- Level08-nc.pr2 = One Gene (Autosomal, XX/XY Sex-Linked, ZZ/ZW Sex-Linked);
				(2 or 3 Alleles); (Incomplete or Hierarchical dominance)
- Level09.pr2 = Two Unlinked Autosomal Genes; 2 Alleles each; Simple Dominance
- Level10.pr2 = Two Linked Autosomal Genes (0.1 < rf < 0.3); 2 Alleles each;
					Simple Dominance
- Level11.pr2 = Two Genes, either XX/XY Sex-Linked or Autosomal; 2 Alleles each; 
					Simple dominance

- Level12.pr2 = Three Linked Autosomal Genes (0.1 < rf < 0.3); 2 Alleles each;
					Simple dominance
- Level13.pr2 = Three Sex-Linked Genes (0.1 < rf < 0.3); 2 Alleles each;
					Simple dominance

also needed to fix one of the problem files
-Level07.pr2 did not allow for sex-linkage

made it version 2.1.0
made mac and pc versions and posted

8/5/10
by request, some wanted the option to have all the field strains pure-breeding
(especially for the 3-factor crosses)
so make new parameter:
	FieldPopTrueBreeding true/false
	default is false

8/10/10
made new problems:
- Level12TB.pr2 = Three Linked Autosomal Genes (0.1 < rf < 0.3); 2 Alleles each;
					Simple dominance; Field population true breeding
- Level12TBp.pr2

- Level10-1.pr2 = Two Unlinked or Linked Autosomal Genes (0.1 < rf < 0.5); 2 Alleles each;
					Simple Dominance
- Level10-1p.pr2
					
call it version 2.1.1

10/28/10
revisions:
- have it save a CageUI's position and visibility when work saved
 -- works!

- have it save the time when a cage was created (for logging purposes)
	in the xml, there is now an Attribute called "Created" which is a string like Thu Oct 28 15:53:58 EDT 2010
experimenatlly tagged it as version 2.1.2

11/11/10
started working on epistasis
created PhenotypeProcessor to deal with phenotypic interactions, etc.
all phenotypes managed in PhenotypeProcessor
route needed stuff thru there
	in GeneticModel
		- getPhenotype
		- getRandomOrganism
		- getNumberOfCharacters
	in Organism
		- getToolTipText
set it up to pass it all through at first..

specifying complementation or epistasis in the .pr2 file works like this:
- if there's going to be compl or epi, it's a special case
	- alternatives are:
		- (no interaction) = one 2-allele simple dominance model
		- (interaction) = two 2-allele simple dominance models that interact
			(they'll be genes 1 and 2)
		*thus, the only relevant specs are sex-linkage chance for the genes 
- so the params are:
	PhenotypeInteraction <float> = chance there'll be epistasis or complementation
	Epistasis <float> = chance, if there's an interaction, that it'll be epistasis
						otherwise, complementation
- if the chance of epistasis or compl > 0, then the alternatives are
	for complementation: one gene 2 allele simple dom
	for epistasis: one gene 3 allele hierarchical dom

the gene models are going to need an index so I can find them

11/12/10
working on it
for .pr2 file, need some more info
Complementation =
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
	<BeginnerMode>True</BeginnerMode>
	<ZZ_ZW>0.0</ZZ_ZW>
	<Gene2_SameChrAsGene1>1.0</Gene2_SameChrAsGene1>
	<Gene2_MinRfToGene1>0.5</Gene2_MinRfToGene1>
	<Gene2_MaxRfToGene1>0.5</Gene2_MaxRfToGene1>
	<PhenotypeInteraction>1.0</PhenotypeInteraction>
</root>

seems to be working!
check #s - 20 crosses of AaBb x AaBb with epistasis (526 offspring)
expect 9:4:3 = 295.875:131.5:98.625
got 302:140:84
on-line chisq calc gives p = .25 so OK!
http://www.people.ku.edu/~preacher/chisq/chisq.htm

now need to:
1) be sure third gene works OK
2) get model to display properly in practice mode
3) get saving and loading to work

Problem with (1) - not enough traits
	so make the interacting geneModels special - they use A, a, B, and b as their phenotypes
	InteractingGeneModel

setting up proper printouts
terms that need to be translated:
Non-Functional
Functional
Epistasis
Complementation

fixed (1) and (2)

got (3) going

11/16/10
seems to be working; do some tests
- be sure that you can run, save, and load:
	- compl models OK
	- 2-allele simple dom models from compl.pr2 OK
	- epi models OK
	- 3-allele hierarch models from epi.pr2 OK
	- regular level1 models OK
	- regular 3-gene models OK
	- be sure you can load an old VGLII model FAIL 
		(needed to deal with contingency of missing Xpos, Ypos, & visibility)
		now OK

** epistasis & complementation are now AOK!!!

11/26/10
UI changes (thanks to Cameron Betts)
- put parent info at top of panel; added titled & colored border
- labeled field pop as such; added titled & colored border
- put phenotypes at left most column(s); added titled & colored border

12/7/10
started working on model building widget

1/11/11
fixed bug in model building widget's detecting if linkage is appropriate
tested with all current problem files & it bhaves properly
(it includes a linkage pane with models 10, 10-1, 12, 12TB, 13 only; 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5-1, 6, 6, 7NC, 8, 8NC, 9, 11, 11-1 do not)

2/6/11
some improvements from sophie
- add to cage manager an "invert selection" button
- made super cross

2/17/11
got Model Builder working and saving
version 3.0.0
sent out for translation from Sophie

2/21/11

			OLD NAME		NEW NAME
			comp.pr2		Complementation01.pr2
			epi.pr2			Epistasis01.pr2

renamed as Interactions01 and 02, respectively

had a REALLY hard time moving the problem files
had to
	- delete the problem file folders
	- commit the change
	- make a new problem file folder
	- commit the change
	- drag 1 set of prob files to folder
	- commit the change
	- make a folder in problems and move the files in
	- commit the change
	(do the last steps for each folder of problems)!
		
for internationalization and grading, need to make ModelBuilder save in english and only display 
in the local language..

make reverseTranslate(String) in Messages - use this in save only
	(so it processes in local language but saves in english)
- reverse translate fails on things like "Body Shape" - it takes 2 translations to do this
	("Body" and "Shape")
		also, what about 2 english words with the same french translation..
- will have to use indices...

2/27/11
working on grader

3/1/11
working on grader, got it to load work
shift-click shows all the cages, etc

3/2/11
cleaned up VGLII.java
	moved out some big methods that could be made static
started graying out grader options in their answer when it wasn't a choice

3/3/11
finished graying out no choice options
started making GeneticModel output html for the grader

3/23/11
getting grader to show prob file name and linkage

problem:
with epi and comp
the model builder shows inc dom as the alternative
but the problem file has others
fix:
	alternative for compl = 2 allele simple dom
	alternative for epi = 2 allele inc dom
fix in GeneticModelFactory, TwoAllelePanel, website

3/24/11
working on cage scoring

3/25/11
ditto
be generous, all sex-link cagesalso give dominance
(actually, you need to know if XX/XY or ZZ/ZW to get full dominance from a 
sex-linkage result, but ok for now)

tested with 
	one gene auto simple
	one gene auto inc
	one gene sex link simple
	two genes sex/auto
	three genes auto

3/26/11
working on security - started by moving encrypt/decrypt of work files to 
	EncryptionTools static methods


4/7/11
changed decryption of grader.key to RSA
made VGL/keys folder and put private.key there (ok; it's used for decryption)
now AOK

4/11/11
problem: loading a lot of files to grade runs out of memory
fix:
	- don't have option to see cages of a problem
	- do all scoring for each file, save html for grader and clean up completely
	
got it to work, but it pops up lots of useless ModelBuilderUIs...

fixed that by making the MBUI a JPanel that only appears if it's built into a dialog
(for grading, it's never shown)

4/16/11
starting to work on SaveForGrading

4/17/11
fixed some bugs
- changed text in ModelBuilderUI to 'for allele interaction type'
- when there was trouble making XML for saving work, it had been quietly dying
	because an exception was being caught but no stack trace
		(made debugging hard)
	- fixed in VGLII.saveProblem()
- if you try to save without showing the model builder, there's an error
	"component must be showing on the screen to determine its location"
	needed to use isShowing() not isVisible() in mbui's save
- nix the "change since last save" feature - always save
	this is because it's very hard to tell if the MBUI has changed
	so just save all the time (remove that boolean from VGL)
- fixed KeyFileChecker so that the password field automaticaslly gets 
	the focus
- a little refactoring to make it easier to use RSA encryption in save for grading
	GeneticModelFactory.readModelFromFile(file)
		split into readfromXML which is called by read from XOREncry file or readRSA
- set up to require:
	student.key for "Save For Grading"
	grader.key AND instructor.key for "Grade Students Work"

Problem, can't rsa encrypt blocks larger than 117 bytes
	need to break up (or punt); see: 
	http://www.aviransplace.com/2004/10/12/using-rsa-encryption-with-java/3/
	http://www.coderanch.com/t/481259/Streams/java/read-text-file-buffer-at

4/19/11
got SaveForGrading working
added some more French & spanish text
version 3.1.0

4/26/11
added dual progress bar for loading grading files
  ones with SUperCross take a LONG time to load

4/27/11
made grader loading progress dialog look better
added a little spanish & french translation

5/3/11
opening files runs very SLOWLY
do profiling:
java -Xrunhprof:cpu=samples,file=log.txt -jar VGLII.jar 

look in log.txt

so its the decryption that takes so long
to fix, reduce the amount to be decrypted
since not showing the cages anyway, just save the html for the grader!

much faster...

did some testing
(of new .gr2 mode)
ran jar file by double-clicking
under mac os
	- took 10 .wr2 files from Patty's "VGLBonus" folder
		opened in VGLII, saved for grading using Patty's new tokens
		saved into "for grading"/
	- all 10 opened in "Grade Students' Work" 
under win xp
	- took 2 more of those .wr2 files
		opened and saved as above
	- all 12 opened in "Grade Students' Work"
back to mac os
	- all 12 opened AOK

therefore, can save for grading in either mac or win and open with either AOK
** good!

fixed bug - closing work left blank ModelBuilder
	need to dispose() of the JDialog

5/4/11
tested with 108 .gr2 files (Patty had reported that, with old, uncompressed .gr2's,
it hung with more than 20

made them by using os x to duplicate the 12 ones I made
then in terminal
for i in *copy; do mv "$i" "${i/.gr2 copy/}"_new.gr2; done

worked AOK with 108 files.

5/5/11
made mac, linux, and pc versions & posted on web

5/18/11
Sophie found a bug in SuperCross - some layout issues in CageUI
	fixed
	version 3.1.2

5/24/11
put back changeSinceLast save and set it up to work with ModelBuilder
still version 3.1.2

5/25/11
made it so that: when you open a work file, VGL remembers the name
	when saves happen - so you save to the same file

made mac, pc, and linux versions and posted

9/23/11
some bug fixes:

1) some had noticed "poison" .wr2 files
	they would partially open - not all the cages
		and then you would not be able to cross, etc
		(it was as though it had never enabled the menus after loading the problem)
	it was when they'd crossed individuals from a super cross - that made an un-openable cage
	beacuse CageUI.getOrganismUIFor(int id) counts up to the masOrgsPerRow not absoluteMaxOrgsPerRow
	fixed that method
now AOK

2) when saving for grading, the dialog still calls them "work files" not "grading files"
	fixed VGL and messages files

- still need french and spanish for "Files for grading"

9/26/11
- double-checked to be sure no more maxOrgsPerRow in CageUI - it's OK
- fixed the translations of "Files for Grading"

9/28/11
made it warn you if you try to save a file with poison characters in the name
version 3.1.4

12/13/11
posted to web after testing

2/5/12
(before this, added Korean menu stuff - still need help's index.html)
added recombination freq to model builder

made CageScorer a real (not static) class to facilitate analysis of linkage

2/6/12
7) Bug: if they rename a .wr2 file as .gr2 it messes up the grader
	need to detect and put "unreadable file" in grader

the error looks like this:

so, maybe detect it in EncryptionTools and return null
then detect that and report that the file was unreadable rather than dying
in the grader, make the entry "Unreadable file; probably a .wr2 renamed to .gr2"

fixed by making EncryptionTools' Document readRSAEncrypted(File inFile, PrivateKey privKey)
return null if unreadable
then fixed GeneticModelFactory's GeneticModelAndCageSet readModelFromRSAFile(File workFile, PrivateKey gradingKey)
return null if it gets a null document from readRSAEncrypted
then WorkFileLoader inserts an appropriate message for the grader if it gets null

tested OK

back to linkage
adding a choice for evidentiary cage

bug - when linkage panel made, there's no mbui - it's null...


4/11/12
added "sex" checkbox to Summary Chart in preparation for chi-squared calculation

added test to LinkagePanel: if mbui == null, just say there are no cages in the list (see above bug)

4/13/12
trying to get org.apache.commons jar file into project
got commons-math3-3.0-bin.tar.gz from http://commons.apache.org/math/download_math.cgi
unzipped and un-tarred
put whole folder under VGLII and saved to SVN

followed instructions from
http://www.java-forums.org/new-java/10601-how-make-apache-commons-stringutils-etc-work-eclipse.html
In eclipse:
A Put the library in the java build path

Window -> Preferences: Java - Build path - User Libraries push the "New..." button, 
	and in the "User library name:" enter 'appache-commons-lang'.
Click to select "appache-commons-lang" in the "Defined user libraries" list 
	and then click on the "Add JARs..." button and browse for commons-lang-2.4.jar 
	(in the folder you've saved earlier) and select it.
Now in the "Defined user libraries", under commons-lang-2.4.jar you have to have
	"Source attachment" and "Javadoc location" ; for each of them, select it, then 
	push "Edit..." , then "External file" and browse for the corresponding jar 
	(/commons-lang-2.4-sources.jar and commons-lang-2.4-sources.jar

B. In your project add this user library
In the Package Explorer right-click on the project name, go to Properties, and 
	select the Libraries tab; click the "Add Library..." button, from the list 
	select "User library" , "Next", mark [x] appache-commons-lang, and click "Finish"

will use ChiSquareTest.chiSquareTest()

4/17/12
needed to add zipfilest src = the math.jar to make apache.commons work

need translations for:
VGLII.Observed=Observed
VGLII.Expected=Expected
VGLII.Chi-sqZeroTitle=Invalid Expected Value
VGLII.Chi-sqZeroText=All Expected values must be > 0.

also help file info

4/19/12
fixed help in english & added tool tip text
will also need translations for tool tip text
VGLII.ExpectedLine1=Enter <u>whole number</u> values for 
VGLII.ExpectedLine2=expected quantities of offspring.
VGLII.ExpectedLine3=\u03C7<sup>2</sup> is calculated when all values entered.

5/25/12
had to fix the apache math stuff
did EXACTLY as above and it worked

got summary chart to print when you print work
korean help html now working
	(had him start with blank text file, save as utf-8, paste in, save and
		e-mail me a .zip file of the html)
added some frehcn text for chi-square

5/29/12
working on misc stuff
- fixed cage lists in linkage panel
- updated the saving, loading, printing, etc of linkage panel
- for now, for evidence of linkage, just give parent genotypes

5/30/12
grader bug - in sex-linkage it's not counting things properly
	it doesn't see the second line of offspring in cage 6 in simple.wr2

6/1/12
working on grader bug
	was looking at phenotype's trait = Eye:Color:Gray
		but want character = Eye:Color and match both Gray and Green (for example)
	also, if any phenotype (Eye:Color:Gray OR Eye:Color:Green) shows a sex-mismatch then sex-linked
		had been doing it only if Eye:Color as a whole showed sex-mismatch
fixed both - test extensively - be sure that: 
	- sex-linkage evidence in any phenotype line is detected <OK>
	- if absent, it's flagged OK <OK>
	- be sure inc dom is also OK <OK>
	- test in multi-gene probs <OK>

also need to test the dominance stuff (didn't change it but just to be sure)
	- detected in any row of display <OK>
	- detected all 3 types <OK>
	- detected in multi-gene probs <OK>

worked on compl & epi evidence detection
	- it should be the same as for the dominance (missing or new phenos)
		so try just using the existing scoring

6/18/12
finished adding Korean stuff
version 3.2.0
made mac, pc, linux versions and posted

6/19/12
UGH - korean html looks bad in korea (but OK in us)
may be because I edited and saved the file 
(best to never touch it)
luckily have a backup in the version I showed to Se-Jin
un-jared it and replaced Help_kr/index.html
  saved a copy in Future/
try in Korea
also updated version to 3.2.1
  and the info file to thank him properly
 
8/24/12
need to sign the app for mac osx mountain lion
export CODESIGN_ALLOCATE="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/codesign_allocate"
codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Brian White" -vf VGLII-3.2.0.app/

12/15/12
working on stuff for edX and lingering items in the to-do list

1) automatic scoring - comparing model builder and right answer


12/16/12
in AutoGrader
	need to fix 
		- linkage checking not right
			need to calculate expected rf for gene 1 - gene 3 - how?
		- when no interaction type selected, the details are "CORRECT"!	
			probably, if interactionType is wrong, can't get details

12/17/12
checking on linkage - if map is A B C and you know rf(AB) and rf(BC)
	can you calculate rf(AC)?
		yes - use map function (Kosambi) rf = 0.5 * tanh(2*(r1 + r2))
tested with 2 problems with order ABC (filed .wr2's with edX stuff)
	1) "3-factor 1.wr2"
		given rf(AB) = 0.20; rf(BC) = 0.23; predict rf(AC) = 0.5 tanh(0.20 + 0.23) = 0.35
		do a super cross with 2000 offspring and measure:
			rf(AB) = 0.22; rf(BC) = 0.23; rf(AC) = 0.34 - all very close
	2) "3-factor 2.wr2"
		given rf(AB) = 0.15; rf(BC) = 0.29; predict rf(AC) = 0.5 tanh(0.20 + 0.23) = 0.34
		do a super cross with 2000 offspring and measure:
			rf(AB) = 0.14; rf(BC) = 0.28; rf(AC) = 0.34 - all very close
conclusion: use the tanh to find the expected freq

set up; now working

test with 2-factor cross - AOK

fixed the interactionType/details issue above

BE SURE TO TEST WITH EPI & COMP (did this on 1/8/13)

1/8/13
setting up to save to edX server
got sample-post.py from Victor Schnayder to show how to save to server

- tested for EPI and comp - OK
- tested if no model entered, it's all wrong
- tested linkage evidence cage OK
- test a weird model
	a non-sex-linked model with proper justification OK
	a sex-liked one - makes error!
		"sex-linked causes error.wr2"
		in checking if cage can show linkage, it looks for recessive allele
			but, if sex-linked and you look for an allele on a null sex-chromo
				you get null
			what to do?
			in Organism - getGenotypeForGene(int i) 
				need to deal properly with null sex chromosomes
			in AutoGrader - ditto
		still a problem - in this prob, if you check cage 3 there's an error
	will need to check sex-linkage evidence carefully
	- seems OK

1/19/13
problem with auto grader and inc dom
	it says it's wrong if they get the order of the homozygotes wrong
		and this should be OK
	that is, for inc dom:
		2-allele:
			t1 and t2 can be exchanged
		3-allele: 
			only the circular permutations of the het's are possible
			normal slot		alternatives
				1			1	3	2
				2			2	1	3
				3			3	2	1
				4			4	6	5
				5			5	4	6
				6			6	5	4
			
	also, the circular permutations of circular dominance <sigh>
		normal slot		alternatives
		  	1			1	3	2
		  	2			2	1	3
		  	3			3	2	1
need to code all of these...

did 'em and tested 'em

all seems to be working for the edX problems!

1/23/13
working on server connection
need both the CookieManager and the "X-CSRFToken" things to get a proper connection
if login works, you get this single line back from the server
{"success": true}

1/28/13
settting up command line interface
GOALS:
	- pass as command-line params
		- edX server stuff
			(if not complete, make object null and error then no save to server)
		- all params found in .pr2 file
			(use config file processor if you can)
		- for test, make config print itself to debug

re-factored GeneticModelFactory's xml parser and tested OK.
command line params will be in this format:
-BeginnerMode=false
	that is:
		separated by whitespace
		start with "-"
		name and value separated by "="
build into genetic model factory

need to be sure save to server disabled unless
	- not practice mode (don't even show it)
	- all edX params AOK
		do this by updating params
			when you try to get the edXparams object, it checks for completeness or returns null

1/29/13
command line is working; need to consider various modes

1) Standard = start with blank screen and open from there (the way it's always been)
	- launch with no params
	- "Save to edX" - absent
	- "new problem" - present

2) Launch with work or problem file = opens with that problem started
	- launch with 1 param = filename.pr2 or .wr2
	- "save to edX" - absent
	- "new problem" - grayed out

3) Launch from edX with no file (so they can look at saved work)
	- launch with 1 param = -edXMode
	- "save to edX" - present
	- "new problem" - absent (and disable key command)

4) Launch from edX with lots of params to open with new problem file specified by params
	- launch with > 1 param 
	- "save to edX" - present
	- "new problem" - absent (and disable key command)

BE SURE:
- when you save an edX started problem, you save the edX params so you can save to edX after re-opening

1/30/13
trying java web start
get error:
	access denied ("java.util.PropertyPermission" "user.home" "read")
need to be able to access the user's home dir if the save their work

try signing the jar
no error message, but the file's mod time was not changed and that didn't help

works if you comment out the stuff at the start where it finds the user's home dir

put testing.keys into project

need to clear temp files each time you send up a new version

needed to fix layout of pswd dialog
got SpringUtilities.java from http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/layout/SpringGridProject/src/layout/SpringUtilities.java

2/4/13
there's a problem with Korean - the grading fails (probably because they use those strange character strings)
need to completely delete Korean - so, in Korea, it won't give an error
	- remove Future/messages_k-_KR.properties (it's an old version)
	- move VGL/messages_k-_KR.properties to Future/
	- edit VGLII.java to remove Korean menus

2/14/13
for edX - set it to remember passwords once entered

also added button and icon to tool bar

for UI testing, use this command
java -jar VGLII.jar -edXCookieURL=x -edXLoginURL=y -edXSubmissionURL=z -edXLocation=a

for saving to server, use this one
java -jar VGLII.jar -edXCookieURL=https://www.edx.org -edXLoginURL=https://www.edx.org/login -edXSubmissionURL=https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.002x/2012_Fall/modx/i4x://MITx/6.002x/problem/Sample_Numeric_Problem/problem_check -edXLocation=input_i4x://MITx/6.002x/problem/Sample_Numeric_Problem_2_1 -BeginnerMode=False -ZZ_ZW=0.0 -Gene1_SexLinked=0.0 

have it saving password - it re-logs in each time

version 3.3.0

2/16/13
many changes for edX
- need not to say "dominant allele" but "dominant phenotype"; many places to fix this:
	(don't bother with translation - just leave it unchanged in other languages)
	- help
	- modelBuilder
- if login fails, but not because of cancel, give them another chance
	(did this by refactoring the edX server communication out of VGLII and into EdXServerUtils first)
	
2/17/13
make "swiss army knife" edX version
if started with params & server OK
	- start BLANK
	- new prob enabled
		pops up dialog to choose practice/not mode
	- open work enabled
do in eventHandler - differnent new problem events (NewProbFromFile, NewProbFromArgs)

2/18/13
need to test these cases:
- save a practice mode file - be sure it opens in practice mode
	need to fix this - now fixed
- start a problem under A, save it, open under B, submit - be sure it submits to A
	need to check this when it's on the web - OK

put up a version "3.3.0 2012-02-18 13:20"

had broken the remember password on successful login thing <sigh>
new version "3.3.0 2012-02-18 16:30"
sent to edX

2/24/13
problems with edx communication
need to make version that reports error text.
version "3.3.0 2012-02-24 15:00"

tested pull request - added this text from text editor
	see if it appears in eclipse - NG so far
	
2/25/13
eclipse working with github
submitted xml was too long for edx
simplified to just grade info
version "3.3.1 2012-02-25 22:00"

2/16/14
added 4 new Interactions files to "Future"
Interactions03 - Interactions01 with 100% chance of complementation
Interactions03p - Interactions01p with 100% chance of complementation
Interactions04 - Interactions02 with 100% chance of epistasis
Interactions04p - Interactions02p with 100% chance of epistasis

4/22/14
fixing some bugs/issues
16) Allow non integer expected values in chi-squared boxes (Sophie J)
	- work in SummaryChartUI

7) change label in ModelBuilder for Linkage from �RF _%� to �_ map units� or �_ centiMorgans�

19)  add Interactions03 04 p to Problems

4/23/14
working on
	8) in practice mode, the baloon help for a cage is "shows evidence of ..."
need to
	- make CageScorer have static only methods
	- move requirement for ModelBuilderUI out of it
	- test with new version
did all but testing the standard grading with a few problems

5/7/14
tested - OK

adding a "comments to instructor" in the model builder (for Julie Noor)
	- limited to 200 characters
	- need to "purify" string to prevent contamination of the xml
		convert to hex ascii (like at http://jovialjava.blogspot.com/2010/05/hex-to-ascii-conversion-in-java.html)
		but some characters are more than 1 byte... DO NOT USE
		- some websites say that JDom makes it safe
			so just try it
textarea keeps changing size - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2454501/how-to-keep-size-of-jtextarea-constant
make "200 char limit" label say "N chars remaining" and make a hard cap on typing

working - need translations in spanish and french and to set up using them

sent for testing to 
	Julie Noor - she says OK
	Sophie Javerzat

5/12/14
added spanish and french translations of Comments to Instructor

need to replace korean fig0 with the one in Future - don't bother, Korean is a mess.

8/3/14
trying to make version 3.2.1 with new features
chi sqaured lib was broken
	added it as external jar

it won't compile! 
	BUILD FAILED ... Class not found: javac1.8

upgraded to new eclipse "luna" - but now the colors are all fucked up in eclipse

version 3.2.1 2014-08-03 14:28

big problem making the app
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/packagingAppsForMac.html
got appbundler.jar 1.0 and put in VGLII/lib
makes a functional app but it defaults to the user's home dir
need the parameter to pass - these are jvm options 
	-Duser.dir=$APP_ROOT
	seems to work
signed it as above
	actually, just did this:
		codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Brian White" -vf VGLII-3.2.1.app/
post on web and test

8/22/14
sigh - apple is f**ing with java again
the new jar bundler doesn't get paths right
VGLII on mac can't find the key files.
need to re-make with old jar bundler
found it in
/Volumes/TimeMachine2/Backups.backupdb/Brian White’s Home Office iMac/2011-07-31-095555/Macintosh HD/usr/share/java/Tools
	Jar Bundler v 13.5.0
try it now
app won't run; gives error
	LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810

try a newer Jar Bundler from
/Volumes/TimeMachine2/Backups.backupdb/Brian White’s Home Office iMac/2013-08-18-094916/Macintosh HD/usr/share/java/Tools
version 14.5.0
same error

even newer version? not available
so this won't work.

need to put key files where they'll be found
tried putting student.key in every directory in the .app and launching and looking for "Save work for grading.." - never see it
need to put in diagnostic

weird
if you use the 			<option value="-Duser.dir=$APP_ROOT" /> in build.xml for target jar
it tries to look in VGLII-3.2.1.app/ for the file
	but, even if it's there, file.exists() returns FALSE!
somehow, changing the user.dir doesn't really work completley
without that flag, it defaults to looking in Users/brian/

works better if you change the KeyFileChecker and EncryptionTools to take files as arguments not filename strings
	fixed for student.key and instructor.key

the files are there but it claims they're not 

there seems to be a new version of jarbundler http://informagen.com/JarBundler/
	jarbundler-2.3.1.jar 
		put in lib
failed - app won't run
nuke the jarbundler thing

may have to go with jar file - but then can't put it in the dock.

tried replacing the VGLII.jar file in the .app - no good (error -10810)

8/23/14 probably, the best way is to pass in a command line parameter to VGL with the $app_root
then set things right at the start

try this
documentation for command line stuff from the appbundler https://java.net/downloads/appbundler/appbundler.html
use <argument value="-D$APP_ROOT" />
	put the "-D" as a flag

works!
need to test on
- os x as jar - OK
- linux
- windows - OK

don't post all new versions - only mac and call it 3.2.1a
notify user group

6/25/15
working on bugs/features

20) There's a likely bug in grading. If you have 2 traits, it can sometimes count the cage in the grader as though it rpvides evidence of 
	dominance for both when it only shows for one. For example: 
		1-leg purple body x 5-leg purple body gives
			several leg lengths, but all purple
	but the grader says that it provides evidence of dominance for BOTH leg number and body color
		it should only do leg number
	this may be because in AutoGrader.java line 54, it counts i by gene models
		but in CageScorer, it counts i by phenotypes

- test to see if this is true

- test in practice mode - the cages are scored right there
- test in graded mode - can't replicate problem...
CONCLUSION: user error

--------------------
21) There may be a bug in ModelBuilder
	when running VGL/Level10.pr2, if it gives you a 2-allele inc dom (3 phenos)
		it may have given blanks as though it was 3-allele inc dom (6 phenos)

From the website, VGL/Level10.pr2 is:
2- or 3- alleles; autosomal, XX/XY or ZZ/ZW sex-linked inheritance; simple-, incomplete-, circular-, or hierarchical- dominance.
try with VGL/Level09 - should be same thing with practice mode
keep pinging until you get a 2-allele inc dom

- yes, you can choose 3-allele inc dom for this, but since it asks for 6 phenos, it's clearly not the right choice
CONCLUSION: not a bug

--------------
22) From Cindy Passmore cpassmore@ucdavis.edu - add a "blood type" model. 3 alleles, 4 phenotypes with 2 dom and 1 codom
	make as specific "BloodTypeGeneModel"
		have specific option to get this type of problem (no need for an alternative)

need 
	a) GeneticModel
	b) ModelBuilderPanel
	c) WorkFileProcessor
	d) GeneticModelFactory

a) take ThreeAlleleCircularDominance and save as BloodTypeGeneModel

b) need to fix ThreeAllelePanel to add Blood type is a choice
	take ThreeCircPanel and save as BloodTypePanel
	
c) did it

d) make it a boolean to specify BloodType - no alternatives
	need to mess with ProblemTypeSpecification also
	
made problem files and put them in VGL/

seems to start and save OK

ModelBuilder isn't displaying right - need to fix


7/1/15
got it working - send out for testing. 

1/26/16
finally got test results and it works
make new version 3.3.0

made linux version
- steal VGL.sh and README.txt from version 3.2.1
- edit as needed
- chmod on VGL.sh and VGL.jar to execute
- remove .DS_Store's
- tar & gz the whole thing
	tar -czvf VGLII.tar.gz VGLII-3.3.0
- tried to test with virtualbox but couldn't get java to run at all - fail.

made windows version:
- use launch4j
	specify the jar and the .exe
	minimum java version 1.6.0
- just use mac's compress to see if that works to make VGLII.pc.zip
	it leaves in _MACOSX/ and .DS_Store
	this page says how to nix these: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10924236/mac-zip-compress-without-macosx-folder
- try zip VGLII.pc.zip -x \*.DS_Store -r VGLII-3.3.0/
- unzip on pc & see what happens
- OK now

made mac version:
- use build.xml's "app" option
- edit build.xml for new version
- make app
- seems OK
- use apple-I to change icon
- need to sign 
	bash (won't work in tcsh)
	export CODESIGN_ALLOCATE="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/codesign_allocate"
	codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Brian White" -vf VGLII-3.3.0.app/
		fails - "Developer ID Application: Brian White: no identity found"

=======

looking into ExclesiorJet native compiler. But, the mac os x apps need xterm - which fusses and needs to be installed.
"Certain Excelsior JET functionality involves running your natively compiled program in a terminal. On Linux, it 
employs xterm for that purpose. For now Excelsior JET for OS X also falls back to xterm, but future versions will 
either employ the standard OS X terminal emulator, Terminal.app, or will have the respective functionality 
reimplemented without such external dependencies."
- don't use it.

there's something else: JWrapper http://www.jwrapper.com/excelsior-jet-alternative.html
it includes a jre - so you won't need to install java
but will it trip anti-java warnings/blockage?
it is also not free.
see if there's an educational discount.

6/20/16
asked this:
	I'm a professor at UMass Boston. I have written two java applications used exclusively for teaching biology that 
	I distribute for free (http://vgl.umb.edu and http://aipotu.umb.edu). These are used around the world and one has 
	won an international award for educational software. I make no money from these. My users are having more and more 
	trouble with java installations etc so I'm looking to make native apps.
	My budget is extremely limited. I looked on your website and was unable to find out what features are present/absent 
	in the free version. Is there an educational discount or a discount for freeware that applies to your product?

Antony (contact@jwrapper.com) replied:
	Thanks for your interest in JWrapper.
	JWrapper Standard can be used for free subject to our license terms.  The features available in JWrapper Standard are 
	listed on the following page.  The features which are excluded are lower down the page under JWrapper Enterprise:
		http://www.jwrapper.com/compare.html
	I would imagine that JWrapper Standard would do everything you need to get native apps built and distributed.
	Our terms are available here: http://www.jwrapper.com/jwrapper-license-details.html

So it looks like it's worth a try.
	need .png for all images or it fails
	main class is VGL.VGLII

seems to work!

try building in the Problems/ folder
	first run is slow - maybe it's installing stuff
	it installs Problems/ into /Users/brian/Library/Application Support/JWrapper-VGLII/JWrapper-VGLII-00044609005-complete
there's a lot of stuff there:

hmmm, it may be working.

need to test to see if the new version runs when java is absent/disabled
	it looks like you have to delete the jre to do this test - dangerous!
	
but will it solve the problem: that people aren't allowed to install software on their computers...

tested on windows
	the first run is VERY slow - next are faster
	it installs stuff in Users\brian.white\AppData\Roaming\JWrapper-VGLII\JWrapper-VGL-00044609005-complete
	along with some other stuff

see if you can find some testers.

motherfuckers at apple zotted java again
from julie.noor@duke.edu
	My TAs just discovered that VGLII 3.3.0 has a glitch with MacOS Sierra (10.12.2).  Even when the 
	application file is in the same folder as the Problems folder and student.key file, there is no 
	"save work for grading" option and when starting a new problem, it doesn't default to opening the 
	Problems folder.  One TA played around and figured out that MacOS is opening the application in 
	a weird read-only temporary folder.  
	
for notes, see above 8/23/14

it looks like the -D option may not be working anymore.

from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7838750/is-there-a-jvm-command-line-option-to-change-directory 
it may be necessary to say -Duser.dir=$APP_ROOT
	not -D$APP_ROOT

FWIW, the directory being used is 
	/private/var/folders/c9/781k1x753y545pmzpdr0s1l80000gp/T/AppTranslocation/74D6CE66-88E2-48A2-9F18-69E18542D541/d/

looked up AppTranslation
https://github.com/potionfactory/LetsMove/issues/56
says 
	As outlined at http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2016/06/29/sierra-and-gatekeeper-path-randomization/, macOS Sierra 
	introduces a new security feature called "Gatekeeper Path Randomization" (or "app translocation", as it's called 
	on the API level). The basic gist is that if you download and run a Gatekeeper app from the Downloads folder, 
	the OS will copy the app into a read-only disk image and run it from there instead. See the link above for more details.

	This applies until the user moves the app to any other location (not just the Applications folder), after which the 
	OS will just run the app normally. However, the move is only recognized if performed using the Finder. If you move 
	the app another way, e.g. using "mv" in the Terminal, the app will continue to be translocated when run, even if 
	it's in /Applications.

some other ideas from https://eclecticlight.co/2016/06/16/macos-sierra-will-break-many-installers-and-updaters/
	make a signed disk image

ask Julie to try moving the /Application folder - didn't work

also set up laptop to run Sierra
