To do list
(items are removed to development log as they are done)

1) have 2 cages to show sex-linkage when needed (when xx/xy or zz/zw are possible)
	need to process both
	
2) a problem like TwoGenes05 where the genes can be linked or unlinked

3) recombination frequency in model builder
	enter numerical value (if they enter "50", it puts "unlinked")
		to nearest 0.1 map unit
	evidentiary crosses
		one parent must be heterozygous for both markers in question
		other parent must have at least one recessive allele for each gene in question

4) chi-square calc to summary chart
	add "sex" as a checkbox to summary chart
	add "expected values" column to summary chart
	when values entered for all possible types
		calculate chi-squared value

5) screenshots of individual cages/windows
	on all windows have menus:
		file:
			close
			print
		edit:
			copy pic to clipboard
			
6) Evidentiary crosses for epistasis and complementation are crosses involving that pheno
	that are conspicuous (kids ­ parents)
