To do list
(items are removed to development log as they are done)

1) have 2 cages to show sex-linkage when needed (when xx/xy or zz/zw are possible)
	need to process both
	
2) a problem like TwoGenes05 where the genes can be linked or unlinked

3) evidentiary crosses for linkage
		one parent must be heterozygous for both markers in question
		other parent must have at least one recessive allele for each gene in question

5) screenshots of individual cages/windows
	on all windows have menus:
		file:
			close
			print
		edit:
			copy pic to clipboard
			
6) Evidentiary crosses for epistasis and complementation are crosses involving that pheno
	that are conspicuous (kids ≠ parents)

7) change label in ModelBuilder for Linkage from “RF _%” to “_ map units” or “_ centiMorgans”

8) in practice mode, the baloon help for a cage is "shows evidence of ..."

9) bug - in linux, save work as tries to put file in root directory, not the selected one

10) bug - in some linux, no title bar for the cage windows (?)

11) VGL applet
	parameter is the problem file
		launches with problem started
	file menu
		new problem
		close problem
		print
	external js buttons
		save work to server
		save for grading
		load from server

12) java web start
	- application (not applet because of javapoclypse)
	- pass as command-line params
		- edX server stuff
			(if not complete, make object null and error then no save to server)
		- all params found in .pr2 file
			(use config file processor if you can)
		- for test, make config print itself to debug
	- based on this, show or don't "save to server" - leave out, not gray
	- starts with field pop
	- no "new problem"
	- keep "save" and "print"
