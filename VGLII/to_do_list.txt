To do list
(items are removed to development log as they are done)

1) have 2 cages to show sex-linkage when needed (when xx/xy or zz/zw are possible)
	need to process both
	
2) a problem like TwoGenes05 where the genes can be linked or unlinked

3) evidentiary crosses for linkage
		one parent must be heterozygous for both markers in question
		other parent must have at least one recessive allele for each gene in question

5) screenshots of individual cages/windows
	on all windows have menus:
		file:
			close
			print
		edit:
			copy pic to clipboard
			
6) Evidentiary crosses for epistasis and complementation are crosses involving that pheno
	that are conspicuous (kids ï¿½ parents)

9) bug - in linux, save work as tries to put file in root directory, not the selected one

10) bug - in some linux, no title bar for the cage windows (?)

11) VGL applet
	parameter is the problem file
		launches with problem started
	file menu
		new problem
		close problem
		print
	external js buttons
		save work to server
		save for grading
		load from server

12) From Julie Noor
I just ran into a student with a VGLII issue I hadn't seen before (and most I've seen MANY times now -- 
you don't have "save for grading" as an option?  move the VGLII program file back into its original folder
 -- etc).  The student submitted a .gr2 file, but when I opened it, all the answers were in gibberish 
 symbols -- I've attached it, along with our .key files in case you want to see what I mean.  
 Our password is 503E95CE  The student had his computer language set to Korean, so that when 
 VGLII ran, all the text was in Korean.  So we think it saved his model builder responses in Korean, 
 but now our computers can't interpret the characters or translate the responses into English.  I don't 
 mean to imply that this is something that you need to fix, I just wanted to give you a heads up in case 
 someone contacts you with a similar problem.
 
 = probably because the korean translation uses character codes not characters
 	so there's no match
 	
14) Change grading html to save the automatic grader output => easier to summarize

15) Include in <Grade>
	- total number of crosses
	- number of crosses after sufficient info
	- for linkage, # of offspring in evidentiary cage


17) In practice mode, have option to turn on/off showing genotypes so it's not a giveaway. (M.C. Cowlishaw)

18) Allow very large numbers of offspring in super cross to allow looking at rare or complex events. (M.C. Cowlishaw)

19)  add Interactions03 04 p to Problems

20) There's a likely bug in grading. If you have 2 traits, it can sometimes count the cage in the grader as though it rpvides evidence of 
	dominance for both when it only shows for one. For example: 
		1-leg purple body x 5-leg purple body gives
			several leg lengths, but all purple
	but the grader says that it provides evidence of dominance for BOTH leg number and body color
		it should only do leg number
