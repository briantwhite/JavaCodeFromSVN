Instructions:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw your molecule</li>
                 <ul> 
                      <li>Draw the skeleton of the molecule by using the horizontal line button
                          - it can be found directly below the "CLR" button - this adds C atoms. 
                          <ul>
                              <li>Alternatively, you can use the ring buttons.</li>
                              <li>Any carbon atom you add can be changed to any other atom 
                                  later.</li>
                          </ul>
                      <li>To change a C to another atom, click on the element's symbol in the 
                           left column, then click on the atom you want to change.</li>
                      <li>To change a bond from double to single (and vice-versa), click on 
                           the horizontal line and then click on the bond you want to change.</li>
                      <li>To delete an atom, click the "DEL" button and then click on the 
                           atom you want to delete.</li>
                      <li>To undo a mistake, click the "UDO" button.</li>
                      <li>To change the charge on an atom, click the "+/-" button and click 
                          the atom whose charge you want to change.</li>
                      <li>To clear your molecule and start over, click the "CLR" button.</li>
                  </ul>
             <li>When you are ready, click the "Calculate logP and formula"
                  button to calculate the logp value and formula of your molecule. </li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>After you have submitted your molecule, you will still be able to 
                          edit it.</li>
                      <li>Note that you must hit the "Calculate" button to update
                           the calculations if you change your molecule.</li>
                  </ul>
             <li>Your results will appear in a box below the panel where you drew the structure.</li>
         </ol>
