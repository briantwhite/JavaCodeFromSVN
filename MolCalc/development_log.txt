but running now gives warning
	Specified VM install not found: type MacOS X VM, name JVM 1.4.2 (MacOS X Default)

Run menu -> External Tools -> External Tools Configurations...
	JRE tab
		was set to "Separate JVM"
		changed to "run in the same jre as the workspace"

now compiles and runs on lion

problem - 7 membered rings with a single heteratom and 3 double bonds are
	counted as "aromatic" so they're one H too few...

interestingly, numNeighborHs is a better H counter 
	except for NH3 NH4+ H2O CH4 - single atoms
maybe in atom, initialize hybridization to sp3 so it will stay at 3 if no bonds made
need to not count H's in reading of smile string
need to count charge as sum of atomic charges

seems to work

fails for H3CCH2-F -Cl -Br -I -SH -> gives one too many H's
it's because Atom.processNeighbor() doesn't count F, Cl, Br, or S in numNeighborXs
is that right or not?
need to check original paper
counted them
seems to work OK

charge wasn't displaying right
now fixed
