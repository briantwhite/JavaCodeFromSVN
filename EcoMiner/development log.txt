7/27/06
original files did not have longitudes!
got file with station #, name, lat, and long from Amber
	namloc2.csv

pasted into data.csv
	removed duplicated columns
	removed pecan column
	called it “JustClimate.csv”

opened in MyWorld
	saved under new name (it had to modify the file) “JustClimate-MW.csv”

worked!!


7/31/06
had e-mailed Amber for the world data with lat & long
got it: WrldLatLong.csv

it just has station #s and lat & long
will have to merge it with WrldToTest.xls
to make a complete world file.
made WrldJustClimate.xls from these
	used “longitude” as longitude
didn’t work with either longitude as “longitude”
	all in one hemisphere or the other
e-mailed Amber again.

 
8/2/06
got from Amber WrldLatLong.xls
which just has lat and long for the world data

merged with WrldToTest.xls

to make WrldJustClimate.xls and .csv

works in MyWorld
burned CD

8/7/06
working on software and files
fixed pecans.arff
	the first @data line has data immediately after it
		added a newline
		saved with unix line breaks
		- put in arffFiles/ in project tree

saved pecans.arff as USClimate.arff
	didn't change anything
	it should work just fine as a climate data file
	
got world.arff as a climate file from  OriginalPecanData/World
	fixed a little in bbedit
		added newlines to make single lines in approp places
	opened in weka to be sure it is OK. - it is.
	
NOTE THAT BOTH CLIMATE FILES LACK LONGITUDE INFO 
	- they must be fixed
	- for now, they are OK for testing purposes
