downloaded the “full iclicker app” from 
	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lfr2m3gc86on8co/AADsebMILQmb1dg1kdDwaCeHa?dl=0

put in eclipse (it has the .project etc files in it)
•	Downloaded zip to desktop (it comes down as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01/)
•	It seems that the .project file specifies the name as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01 (ugh)
•	In eclipse, try Import -> General -> existing projects into workspace
o	Check the box “Copy projects into workspace” - IMPORTANT
•	Seemed to work

Add to git
•	Right-click the project -> Team-> Add to index
•	Commit
•	Push to upstream
•	Check on github.com – all there!

Now, need to build it.
Make build.xml
Error – ant didn’t like javac1.8
Updated to newest ant a la http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23442621/ant-class-not-found-javac1-8

Now get this runtime error from 
Test.java line 204
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Directory separator should not appear in library name: lib/hidapi-jni
if you take out the lib/ - then it can't find it
so need to make the lib/ a library?
hmmm..
