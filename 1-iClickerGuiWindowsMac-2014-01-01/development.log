downloaded the “full iclicker app” from 
	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lfr2m3gc86on8co/AADsebMILQmb1dg1kdDwaCeHa?dl=0

put in eclipse (it has the .project etc files in it)
•	Downloaded zip to desktop (it comes down as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01/)
•	It seems that the .project file specifies the name as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01 (ugh)
•	In eclipse, try Import -> General -> existing projects into workspace
o	Check the box “Copy projects into workspace” - IMPORTANT
•	Seemed to work

Add to git
•	Right-click the project -> Team-> Add to index
•	Commit
•	Push to upstream
•	Check on github.com – all there!

Now, need to build it.
Make build.xml
Error – ant didn’t like javac1.8
Updated to newest ant a la http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23442621/ant-class-not-found-javac1-8
	put apache ant in Applications/eclipse

Now get this runtime error from 
Test.java line 204
	originally 		System.loadLibrary("lib/hidapi-jni");
	
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Directory separator should not appear in library name: lib/hidapi-jni
if you take out the lib/ - then it can't find it
so need to make the lib/ a library?
hmmm..

no lib/hdapi-jni file
try hidapi.jar (mac?)
     [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no hidapi.jar in java.library.path

asked the author, Junhao Shi (99ellsworth@gmail.com) about putting the lib/ in the .jar
he replied:
no, it should be something like this:
- src
- bin
- some other random folder
- lib
    \- iClickerDriver.jar (what I wrote)
    |- hidapi.jar (java wrapper of native hidapi library)
    |- hidapi.dll (native library for windows)
    |- libhidapi-jni.jnilib (native library for Mac)

{I'm not sure what he means..}

asked him about the error above & he said:
Hey Brian,

I agree this part is always mysterious. I am pretty sure my colleague has tested this configuration on his 
Mac and it worked. Somehow it does not work on my mac. I just tested :-(

The following modification should work. You can have a try.
1. change line 204 to System.loadLibrary("hidapi-jni"), which you already did;
2. in your first attached image {Properties, java build path, libraries}, click hidapi.jar, it 
	should show an item called native library location, 
	double click it and set it to the .../1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01/lib.

I tested on my Mac and it works. You may need to change everything back when you actually run it on Windows.

tried this - no go
     [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no hidapi-jni in java.library.path

in Test.java line 204, tried "hidapi" and "hidapi.jar" "libhidapi-jni" and "libhidapi-jni.jnilib" - no good

maybe it's because the files in lib/ are in the root level of the jar, not in the lib/ folder
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9348643/java-jar-ant-include-folder
changed in build.xml
    	    <fileset dir="lib/"/>
to
    	    <fileset dir="." includes="lib/**"/>
no good; same error
put it back

try to find out what java.library.path is
add line to Test.java
it gives
/Users/brian/Library/Java/Extensions:/Library/Java/Extensions:/Network/Library/Java/Extensions:/System/Library/Java/Extensions:/usr/lib/java:.

info on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403788/java-lang-unsatisfiedlinkerror-no-dll-in-java-library-path
tried
    	File f = new File("lib/libhidapi-jni.jnilib");
		System.load(f.getAbsolutePath());
works but new error 
 [java] Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group
googling suggests that this is in swing-layout-1.0.4.jar
	tried the "native library" trick from above - no luck
this appears to be NetBeans

10/1/14
try taking out the swing-layout-1.0.4.jar from the libraries and putting it back (voodoo)
	no good

try putting in 
	    	<zipfileset src="lib/swing-layout-1.0.4.jar" />
this works 
now it can't find the class  com/csvreader/CsvReader
as well as others as I incrementally added <zipfileset
try putting in
			<zipfileset src="lib/javacsv.jar" />
	    	<zipfileset src="lib/iClickerDriverWindowsMac.jar" />
	    	<zipfileset src="lib/hidapi.jar" />
 got it running
 but if I start session, I get
     [java] java.lang.Exception: Fail to receive Set Frequency Ack
     [java] 	at iClickerDriver.IClickerDriverOld.startBaseStation(IClickerDriverOld.java:68)
     [java] 	at content.ClickerControlStation.<init>(ClickerControlStation.java:38)

     [java] 	at gui.StartSession$2.actionPerformed(StartSession.java:83)
 
 I'll bet it's not loading the library properly
 go back and look at java.library.path
 /Users/brian/Library/Java/Extensions:/Library/Java/Extensions:/Network/Library/Java/Extensions:/System/Library/Java/Extensions:/usr/lib/java:.
 it does include "." = the current directory
 so, it should find the file if I use System.loadLibrary("lib/hidapi-jni")
 get this error
      [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Directory separator should not appear in library name: lib/hidapi-jni
 try putting a copy of libhidapi-jni.jnilib in same directory as UBCClicker.jar and removing lib/
 
 still no good
 with white base, the program starts but when you start a question, many errors occur including:
     [java] java.lang.Exception: Fail to receive reset counter Ack
     [java] 	at iClickerDriver.IClickerDriverOld.startAcceptingVotes(IClickerDriverOld.java:152)
     [java] 	at content.ClickerControlStation.startAcceptingVotes(ClickerControlStation.java:75)
 
 so, it looks like this library change was not helpful
 	set it back to the way it was System.load(
 	
 same errors - Junhao says:
 This is really unfortunate. Re-produceable software is harder to achieve than I thought :-(

For a quick fix, assume you will always use the white base station (actually the old black one is hard to find nowadays),
 you can do the following:

Remove the in the package explorer of eclipse, expand the menu "Referenced Libraries" for your project, select 
iClickerDriverWindowsMac.jar, right click and select remove from Build Path.

Attached is a .jar that I modified only works with the white base station. You can 
1. copy that into your lib folder; 
2. expand the lib menu in the package explorer of eclipse, select iClickerDriverWindowsMac2.jar; 
3. right click and select Build Path -> add to build path.

Basically we replaced the original driver with the new one. I don't have a base station with me so I am not 
sure if it work perfectly, but I believe it will.

Let me know if it does not work out well.

Best,
Junhao

put his iClickerDriverWindowsMac2.jar in lib/
followed his directions
no good
