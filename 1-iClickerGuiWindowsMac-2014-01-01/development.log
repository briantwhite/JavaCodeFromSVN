downloaded the “full iclicker app” from 
	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lfr2m3gc86on8co/AADsebMILQmb1dg1kdDwaCeHa?dl=0

put in eclipse (it has the .project etc files in it)
•	Downloaded zip to desktop (it comes down as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01/)
•	It seems that the .project file specifies the name as 1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01 (ugh)
•	In eclipse, try Import -> General -> existing projects into workspace
o	Check the box “Copy projects into workspace” - IMPORTANT
•	Seemed to work

Add to git
•	Right-click the project -> Team-> Add to index
•	Commit
•	Push to upstream
•	Check on github.com – all there!

Now, need to build it.
Make build.xml
Error – ant didn’t like javac1.8
Updated to newest ant a la http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23442621/ant-class-not-found-javac1-8
	put apache ant in Applications/eclipse

Now get this runtime error from 
Test.java line 204
	originally 		System.loadLibrary("lib/hidapi-jni");
	
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Directory separator should not appear in library name: lib/hidapi-jni
if you take out the lib/ - then it can't find it
so need to make the lib/ a library?
hmmm..

no lib/hdapi-jni file
try hidapi.jar (mac?)
     [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no hidapi.jar in java.library.path

asked the author, Junhao Shi (99ellsworth@gmail.com) about putting the lib/ in the .jar
he replied:
no, it should be something like this:
- src
- bin
- some other random folder
- lib
    \- iClickerDriver.jar (what I wrote)
    |- hidapi.jar (java wrapper of native hidapi library)
    |- hidapi.dll (native library for windows)
    |- libhidapi-jni.jnilib (native library for Mac)

{I'm not sure what he means..}

asked him about the error above & he said:
Hey Brian,

I agree this part is always mysterious. I am pretty sure my colleague has tested this configuration on his 
Mac and it worked. Somehow it does not work on my mac. I just tested :-(

The following modification should work. You can have a try.
1. change line 204 to System.loadLibrary("hidapi-jni"), which you already did;
2. in your first attached image {Properties, java build path, libraries}, click hidapi.jar, it 
	should show an item called native library location, 
	double click it and set it to the .../1-iClickerGuiWindowsMac-2014-01-01/lib.

I tested on my Mac and it works. You may need to change everything back when you actually run it on Windows.

tried this - no go
     [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no hidapi-jni in java.library.path

in Test.java line 204, tried "hidapi" and "hidapi.jar" "libhidapi-jni" and "libhidapi-jni.jnilib" - no good

maybe it's because the files in lib/ are in the root level of the jar, not in the lib/ folder
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9348643/java-jar-ant-include-folder
changed in build.xml
    	    <fileset dir="lib/"/>
to
    	    <fileset dir="." includes="lib/**"/>
no good; same error
put it back

try to find out what java.library.path is
add line to Test.java

info on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403788/java-lang-unsatisfiedlinkerror-no-dll-in-java-library-path
tried
    	File f = new File("lib/libhidapi-jni.jnilib");
		System.load(f.getAbsolutePath());
works but new error 
 [java] Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group
googling suggests that this is in swing-layout-1.0.4.jar
	tried the "native library" trick from above - no luck
this appears to be NetBeans
