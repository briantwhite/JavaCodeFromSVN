Notes on the Greenhouse - maybe start here
- save all organisms in the Gh in one big .greenhouse json file (or xml, whichever is easier)
- for each organism, save DNA only
- do save folded protein archive

- don't save color - figure that out since it's quick and also converting colors is a pain
- on startup, it looks for starting.greenhouse in the web directory and loads it
- have menu item to replace current Gh with file
- have menu item to save it to .greenhouse file on local disk

- when you load them - fill the folded protein archive first, then build the organisms
	make folded protein archive an actual part of the greenhouse
	** when you save folded protein archive with greenhouse - only save the pertinent entries

BIOCHEM
- if folding on the browser is slow:
	- have it call out to a folding server
		- the server won't keep a local folded protein archive 
			- the proteins will not be common across individual users
			- it will need maintenance (cron job - mysql database etc)
		- local computers keep their own folded protein database

EVOLUTION
- progress bar options
	- a bar that ticks off as each of the cells is computed
	- just have the cells appear as they are computed
	

USELESS CLASSES TO EVENTULLY NUKE
Biochem
- ProteinHistoryCellRenderer (replaced by BiochemHistListItem)
- ProteinPrinter (use screenshots)
Genetics
- GeneticsHistoryCellRenderer (replaced by GeneticsHistListItem)
Mobo
- DNAHistoryCellRenderer (replaced by MolBiolHistListItem)


THINGS YOU EVENTUALLY NEED TO FIX
- in GridCanvas line 207 restore the background color from BiochemWorkbench (once you get that going)
