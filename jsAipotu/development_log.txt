started setting up project

follow recipe in jsVGL

in eclipse
- new google -> web application project
	name: jsAipotu
	package: edu.umb.jsAipotu
	create new project in workspace
- team -> add to index
- team -> commit (initial commit)
- team -> push to upstream

worked.

nuked useless stuff:
-src/edu.umb.jsAipotu/client
	GreetingService & GreetingServiceAsnych
package edu.umb.jsAipotu.server
package edu.umb.jsAipotu.shared

keep getting errors that are just annoying but I can't fix:

An error has occurred. See error log for more details.
Path must include project and resource name: /.gitignore

but .gitignore is in the repository root as well as the project root
can't find this error on google
posted to StackExchange with question "Eclipse 2020-09 (4.17.0) on OS X 10.13 keeps wanting me to put .gitignore and .DS_store on the path"

moved in packages
- make new package eg edu.umb.jsAipotu.client.Genetics
- go into Aipotu/Genetics
- select all; copy
- click new package; paste

after reboot, the "path..." error is gone until first use of git.

try going into .gitignore and deleting the only listing there "/test-classes/"
may have done it - no. It now fusses about .DS_Store and .gitignore.
no help.

in the git settings for Eclipse, the default location is /Users/brian/git/
	there is no .gitignore there - add it and see. NO HELP.

try going to Team -> Advanced -> Clean... and cleaning everything it found.

hmm. now it seems only to be fussing about .DS_Store

try removing all of them from the repo https://intellipaat.com/community/9089/how-can-i-remove-dsstore-files-from-a-git-repository-gitignore-dsstore
go to /Users/brian/git
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
it failed because this directory isn't a repo
went into /Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/
created empty .gitignore
then ran
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
	ran OK
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m '.DS_Store banished'
