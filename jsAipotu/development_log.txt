started setting up project

follow recipe in jsVGL

in eclipse
- new google -> web application project
	name: jsAipotu
	package: edu.umb.jsAipotu
	create new project in workspace
- team -> add to index
- team -> commit (initial commit)
- team -> push to upstream

worked.

nuked useless stuff:
-src/edu.umb.jsAipotu/client
	GreetingService & GreetingServiceAsnych
package edu.umb.jsAipotu.server
package edu.umb.jsAipotu.shared

keep getting errors that are just annoying but I can't fix:

An error has occurred. See error log for more details.
Path must include project and resource name: /.gitignore

but .gitignore is in the repository root as well as the project root
can't find this error on google
posted to StackExchange with question "Eclipse 2020-09 (4.17.0) on OS X 10.13 keeps wanting me to put .gitignore and .DS_store on the path"

moved in packages
- make new package eg edu.umb.jsAipotu.client.Genetics
- go into Aipotu/Genetics
- select all; copy
- click new package; paste

after reboot, the "path..." error is gone until first use of git.

try going into .gitignore and deleting the only listing there "/test-classes/"
may have done it - no. It now fusses about .DS_Store and .gitignore.
no help.

in the git settings for Eclipse, the default location is /Users/brian/git/
	there is no .gitignore there - add it and see. NO HELP.

try going to Team -> Advanced -> Clean... and cleaning everything it found.

hmm. now it seems only to be fussing about .DS_Store

try removing all of them from the repo https://intellipaat.com/community/9089/how-can-i-remove-dsstore-files-from-a-git-repository-gitignore-dsstore
go to /Users/brian/git
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
it failed because this directory isn't a repo
went into /Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/
created empty .gitignore
then ran
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
	ran OK
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m '.DS_Store banished'

testing. FIXED!

need to set up the gui sensibly
here's a good reference site: http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuide.html

Notes on the Greenhouse - maybe start here
- save all organisms in the Gh in one big .greenhouse json file (or xml, whichever is easier)
- for each organism, save it all:
	- upper/lower DNA
	- upper/lower AA seq
	- upper/lower protein struct
	- upper/lower color
	- overall color
- on startup, it looks for starting.greenhouse in the web directory and loads it
- have menu item to replace current Gh with file
- have menu item to save it to .greenhouse file on local disk

start going class-by-class and fixing the errors & note anything special
* lots of things fixed by 'organize imports' - do this for all classes with errors first

- only molBiol has residual errors

edit molGenExp/MolGenExp.java to 
	not have a main method - it will be instantiated by JsAipotu.java
	nix greehouseLoader since greenhouse will hold all needed info on each organism

try to gwt compile and get this error:
[ERROR] Line 13: No source code is available for type edu.umb.jsAipotu.molGenExp.MolGenExp; did you forget to inherit a required module?
[ERROR] Hint: Check the inheritance chain from your module; it may not be inheriting a required module or a module may not be adding its source path entries properly

but the class is there. What's up?
sometimes, this is an issue with edu.umb.jsAipotu/JsAipotu.gwt.xml but it looks the same as the one from JsVGL

this link http://codeinventions.blogspot.com/2014/12/no-source-code-is-available-for-type-did-you-forget-to-inherit-a-required-module.html
says it's because I'm trying to use non-gwt thingies in a gwt project.
Probably the GUI classes.
If you take out the instantiation of an MolGenExp, the error disappears.

Try building the MGX GUI in JsAipotu.java bit by bit - based on MolGenExp.java (which you'll eventually delete)

started with menu.
