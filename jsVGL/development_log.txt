GOALS:
- javascript vgl
- run from params (no .pr2 files)
	(like the version for edx)
- save state to server
- grade on server

started off
in eclipse
- new google -> web application project
- team -> share project via git
- repo is /Users/briantwhite/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/
- team -> add to index
- team -> commit (initial commit)
- team -> push to upstream

worked.

nuked useless stuff:
-src/edu.umb.jsVGL/client
	GreetingService & GreetingServiceAsnych
package edu.umb.jsVGL.server
package edu.umb.jsVGL.shared

moved in packages
- make new package eg edu.umb.jsVGL.client.GeneticModels
- go into VGLII/GeneticModels
- select all; copy
- click new package; paste

for images, may want to use ImageBundle

moved to home mac
needed to adjust build path to add App Engine SDK 1.7.4 
	this eliminates the red exclamation point

start resolving errors:
xml stuff 
	- should be: com.google.gwt.xml.client.Document etc.
	- can't make an Element directly
		need to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6895322/create-xml-document-on-gwt-client-side
			make a doc and have it make element from a document
		but it can't find the type com.google.gwt.xml.Element even though it's being imported
		need to add the jar
			tried from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4
			got http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4/gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
			made folder jsVGL/library (it's in git/)
				put the jar in there
				Project -> java build path
					added jar - gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
				Build project - now OK
it might be better to (from: https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsXML)
	To get to the DOM nodes from the Document object, we can use one of three methods. 
	The getDocumentElement() method retrieves the document element (the top element at the root of the DOM tree) 
	as an Element. We can then use the navigation methods of the Node class from which Element derives 
	(e.g., getChildNodes(), getNextSibling(), getParentNode(), etc.) to drill down and retrieve the data we need.

maybe use getDocumentELement()?

also, don't addContent(), instead appendChild()

also nuke out all i18n

3/6/12
also nuke out all HTML for grading stuff

for the jDialog()'s (all the cages, etc) => use DialogBox

for the moment, leave out:
	- model builder
	- phenotype images
	- cage manager
comment the out in VGL for now
