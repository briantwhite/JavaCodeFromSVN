GOALS:
- javascript vgl
- run from params (no .pr2 files)
	(like the version for edx)
- save state to server
- grade on server

started off
in eclipse
- new google -> web application project
- team -> share project via git
- repo is /Users/briantwhite/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/
- team -> add to index
- team -> commit (initial commit)
- team -> push to upstream

worked.

nuked useless stuff:
-src/edu.umb.jsVGL/client
	GreetingService & GreetingServiceAsnych
package edu.umb.jsVGL.server
package edu.umb.jsVGL.shared

moved in packages
- make new package eg edu.umb.jsVGL.client.GeneticModels
- go into VGLII/GeneticModels
- select all; copy
- click new package; paste

for images, may want to use ImageBundle
http://mangstacular.blogspot.com/2012/01/gwt-image-bundles.html
http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/DevGuideDefiningAndUsingImageBundle



moved to home mac
needed to adjust build path to add App Engine SDK 1.7.4 
	this eliminates the red exclamation point

start resolving errors:
xml stuff 
	- should be: com.google.gwt.xml.client.Document etc.
	- can't make an Element directly
		need to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6895322/create-xml-document-on-gwt-client-side
			make a doc and have it make element from a document
		but it can't find the type com.google.gwt.xml.Element even though it's being imported
		need to add the jar
			tried from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4
			got http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4/gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
			made folder jsVGL/library (it's in git/)
				put the jar in there
				Project -> java build path
					added jar - gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
				Build project - now OK
it might be better to (from: https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsXML)
	To get to the DOM nodes from the Document object, we can use one of three methods. 
	The getDocumentElement() method retrieves the document element (the top element at the root of the DOM tree) 
	as an Element. We can then use the navigation methods of the Node class from which Element derives 
	(e.g., getChildNodes(), getNextSibling(), getParentNode(), etc.) to drill down and retrieve the data we need.

maybe use getDocumentELement()?

also, don't addContent(), instead appendChild()

also nuke out all i18n

3/6/12
also nuke out all HTML for grading stuff

for the jDialog()'s (all the cages, etc) => use DialogBox

3/7/13
still working on xml
for the moment, leave out:
	- model builder
	- phenotype images
	- cage manager
comment the out in VGL for now

3/8/13
tried to build
it couldn't find Unable to find 'com/google/gwt/xml/client.gwt.xml'
maybe they're in the classes in gwt-user.jar?
don't download the jar
in project -> properties -> build path
	add it as external jar
		Mac HD/Applications/eclipse/plugins/com.google...../gwt-2.5.0/gwt-user.jar
			(found using spotlinght)
still ng
maybe it was just that I didn't need the line in the JsVGL.gwt.xml file that read
	<!--    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.xml.client.'/> -->


3/9/13
nuked phenotype images

testing git fuckups

3/10/13
still trouble with xml code
googled: eclipse "no source code is available for type com.google.gwt.xml"
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-web-toolkit/tnlRUoaE6ME
added this to JsVGL.gwt.xml
finally OK
 <inherits name ="com.google.gwt.xml.XML"/> 

 - got the UI basically working
 
3/11/13
need to put on hold
things to do:
1) punt summary chart for now
2) have "close work without saving" button to get to new problem
3) need "load work" button
4) disable save in practice mode
5) check inter-cage crosses
6) need to make edx-interaction


3/12/13
testing git nonsense
now from eclipse

4/3/13
working on model builder ui
left off in model pane fixing all errors

4/9/13
lots of work on Model Builder

4/11/13 prefixed all .css styles with jsVGL_ to avoid conflicts with edx and other cms's
working on ThreeIncPanel

4/15/13 finished all MBUI panels' layouts
working on grader output

popup cages are a pain
	they don't drag nicely
	they overlap and it's hard to bring them to the front
	they cover the controls
	they'll be messy in a web-based environment
put them in scrollable list

4/16/13
working on non-popup cages
got them working
working on save state - ok all but ModelBuilderState
working on load state - ok all but ModelBuilderState!

4/18/13
working on loading model builder state
only part NG is getting the interaction details panel to change

programmatically changing the ListBox doesn't fire a ChangeEvent
	you have to do it yourself
	- works!

need to be able to zip the problemXML
use http://code.google.com/p/gwt-lzma/
unzipped in downloads
copied org/ folder to workspace
	it made lots of top-level directories for each subdir!
	try importing it - no good
	drag it in to src/
	
may not work - it looks like zip is not designed to run in a browser
	there's a warning at the site for gwt-lzma
take it out

use one-byte to 2-byte compression
	write algorithm - safe as long as we use ascii
	
just make the xml tags smaller for organisms
	Organism = "O"
		id = "i"
		CageId = "c"
		male = use "S" = "M" (male) or "F" (female)
	Chromosome = "C"
		id = "PA", "MA", "PS", "MS"
		size = "s"
	Allele = "A"
		GeneIndex = "i"
		TraitNumber = "n"

almost working...

4/19/13
got it working
can make it more compact
	for allele, give i = <GeneIndex>,<TraitNumber>
	for organism, collapse id, cageId, sex into comma-sep
seems to be working with 2 genes

set up layout to be more pretty
set up on practice mode
	can't save
	model builder shows model
working!

tried compiling it
runs aok on firefox
on chrome, get error:
Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL 
	file:///Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsVGL/war/JsVGL.html 
	from frame with URL file:///Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsVGL/war/jsvgl/1629246A986A8ED8C204259F41AF0F24.cache.html. 
	Domains, protocols and ports must match.

really unclear what this means...
some hint here http://maxrohde.com/2011/05/20/gwt-script-does-not-load-in-chrome-and-internet-explorer/
the hint there said to put on web server
tried on securebio and it works!
	http://www.securebio.umb.edu/edX/war/JsVGL.html

problems with supercross
	one with a two gene problem and 2000 offspring saves 290,586 bytes (uncompressed)
	a single field pop cage took 6,020 bytes (uncompressed)
	
possible solution: the problem is just supercross
	- for supercross only:
		just save the organisms that are displayed
		save the counts for display
add field to Organism: visibleInCage - if it is visible in the CageUI
	for regular cages, all are visible
	for super cross, only save and load visible ones

almost working - two bugs
	- on re-open, there are fewer orgs in the supercross panel
	- on re-reopen from intermediate save, there's an error missing parent.
	(probably related)

4/20/13
	- problem is, on save of already processed super cross cage, the code that finds a subset of orgs to display
		loses some because it expects a huge number, so not showing them all is ok
	solution: add boolean alreadyBeenTrimmed (set on loading a supercross from xml) => means:
		- should lay out orgs like regular cross
		- display counts using saved data not counts of organisms saved
took a little doing
	- layout is not exactly the same as regular
	- need to be careful about saving actual counts in super cross vs saved counts
WORKING!

4/22/13
problem with super cross display 
	if only one row of offspring, need to add spacer row just in case
 FIXED

4/23/13
need to export public methods for access from javascript in page
	https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsJSNI
got it going

some bugs
- sex linkage not grading right
- linkage panel is ugly

6/26/13
working on misc bugs
1) sex-linkage not grading right
	it looks like, if not sex-linked, and you select not sex linked, it's marked wrong
	it may always be marked false...
	the problem was "NotSexLinked" vs "Not Sex Linked" vs "Not Sex-Linked"
fixed
2) linkage panel isn't that ugly... (leave alone)
3) need to fail gracefully if ugly state XML
	on openProblem - have it catch any exceptions and put up a warning
did it
4) want, if present, to have a nice HTML panel to show grading info
	grades overall model correctness and justification
	
6/28/13
added ability to open saved files in practice mode and have model shown

7/23/13 testing git
			 
9/8/13
bug - the LinkagePanel settings were being saved but not re-loaded
I'd forgotten to do it <sigh>
implemented it
version 1.1

9/11/13
re-commmitting after git screwup
testing
9/12/13
testing again

9/20/13
fixing misc
- instructions text
- width of instructions
- pass grade param <NumCages>

3/18/14
working on adding "collapse cage" option
in CageUI - removed lines putting captionedDetailsPanel in different places depending on beginnerMode or not
	(probably obsolete) - these are from the bottom of private void setupOrganismPanel()
		if (id > 1) {
			superPanel.add(captionedDetailsPanel, DockPanel.SOUTH);
		} else {
			if (isBeginner) {
				superPanel.add(captionedDetailsPanel, DockPanel.NORTH);
			} else {
				superPanel.add(captionedDetailsPanel, DockPanel.CENTER);
			}
		}

got it basically working
made gwt-compiled version
version 1.3

8/8/14
need to recompile with xsiframe flag to deal with SOP stuff
first, have to get rid of red exclamation point in Eclipse

in Properties, java build path, it says folder test is missing
	just delete it

gwt-user.jar is also missing
	find it in Applications/eclipse/plugins/com.google.gwt.eclipsesdk.../gwt2.6.0/gwt-user.jar

now ok to compile
worked - it seems to be set with  <add-linker name="xsiframe"/> in src/edu.umb.jsVGL/JsVGL.gwt.xml
try putting on server

can't use json-converted version of xml
	huge
	not parsed properly
so used JSON.stringify and had to replace escaped quotes with regular ones (in jsVGL.js)
works!!

8/11/14
parsing the grade when it's xml is a pain 
put back the json code for GRADE only in jsVGL.js

4/3/18
First, get it so there are no errors in the eclipse on my laptop
	try project => properties => gwt => general: enable GWT 
	still a red exclamation point
need to show it gwt-user.jar
	it's in /Users/brianwhite/.p2/pool/plugins/com.gwtplugins.gwt.eclipse.sdkbundle.gwt27_2.7.0.201710131939/gwt-2.7.0/
	use command-shift-period to show the hidden directories in the open dialog

4/4/18
fixed the index.html and associated problems JsVGLA - F for demonstration purposes
put on web

4/29/19
thinking about load and save
on office mac, need to fix warning "!"
in project -> properties -> build path
	add it as external jar
		Mac HD/Applications/eclipse/plugins/com.google...../gwt-2.6.0/gwt-user.jar
			(found using spotlinght)
fixed that problem 
but GWT compile gives "java.lang.NullPointerError" 
and there's a red x by the project but nowhere else!
	fixed this by going to Problems pane at bottom, right-clicking and choosing delete.

can't get rid of the null pointer - tried deleting and reinstalling and re-selecting the SDK
from the "Error Log" tab, got the error
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at com.google.gwt.eclipse.core.launch.GWTLaunchConfiguration.maybeGetDevJarPath(GWTLaunchConfiguration.java:176)

	at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)
google is no help.

tried setting gwt-user.jar to the one in ~/.p2/.... still NG.

the error is "Project 'jsVGL' does not have any GWT SDKs on its build path" - but it does!
WTF?
try the various purges here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8540620/the-project-xxx-does-not-have-any-gwt-sdks-on-its-build-path
finally, it worked to go to Project Properties -> Order and Export and moving the GWT SDK to the top of the list (right under
the project itself)!

see about getting it to save a file https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js
first, fix all jsVGLx.html to use the local - not EdX version (old server is https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-org-mitx/7.00x/jsvgl/jsvgl.nocache.js
adding save work button - the container is in jsVGLA.html (only; for now).
OOPS - this needs to be in the jsVGLx.html since FileSaver.js is external to jsVGL.java
use the window.getStateXML() functions like they're used in jsVGL.js

got xml2json.js from https://gist.github.com/czue/464479
	didn't work...
	try getting it from the 111F18 SPOC backup - NG
	try from https://github.com/abdolence/x2js
		seems OK

Make FileUtils.js separate js file for use by all save/load buttons.
Works!

Need 
1) find a clever way to get a filename from the user
2) don't enable the "Save work" button until there's something to save and there's a filename.
	have it pop up error dialogs

Ideas:
- have a text entry blank with notes 
	- will save to desktop
	- will have .jsvgl extension (add if not typed by user)
- for opening files, have a separate page jsVGLOpen.html
	with a file-open
	no new problem or clear workspace buttons
	do have save button

 file structure notes:
 - since header and footer are pretty similar, use some standard header and footer files
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8988855/include-another-html-file-in-a-html-file
   although this looks like a pain

5/8/19
working on jsVGLA.html to get it running
got file saving to work with useful safeguards

now for loading...
seems to be built into javascript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications
make jsVGLOpen.html based on jsVGLA.html

can't delete the new problem buttons or get a null reference on load
	hide them instead https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910349/hiding-table-data-using-div-style-displaynone
not quite working yet

5/9/19
got it working - no encryption on the .jsvgl files (yet?)
update all .html files
post all on website and see what the community says.

11/8/19
fixed some of the TextStrings to explain the difference between graded and practice problems - some users were confused

6/12/20
need to do some additions to use it in remote Bio 111
1) have it be able to start off with a saved file (equivalent to a .wr2) from a web page
	'open saved work ...'
2) when it's in graded mode, save in lightly encrypted (XOR with passphrase?)
3) when it's in practice mode, save unencrypted
4) have a save to html like in VGLII so they can have their data in an easy form
	'export data'
5) maybe move all buttons (except cross) to a menu to save space and be more organized
	call menu "File"
	
started work on Version 2.0
- add menu first.
because this changes the page layout - all the jsVGL.html files will need to be updated.

got menu working 
6) one issue - the disabled items don't look different.
 - figure out how to gray them out
 - maybe have enabled and disabled styles and set style when enabled/disabled

6/15/20
other things
7) on menu items, have tool tip text that explains 
	'save work in progress to open later or submit to your TA"
	"save your results in a form that can be opened by a word processor"
8) clear workspace should have "are you sure" dialog
9) do you need the Base64Encoder? check in regular VGL how it's used
10) fix instructions to match the file menus not buttons
11) in file saving dialogs have notes
	"this file can be opened by jsVGL to continue your work or submitted for grading"
	"this file can be opened in a word processor; it can't be opened by jsVGL"
12) have "open work..." that opens a saved work file
13) play with menu style to have it match the rest

did:
(5)
(6)
(7) is too much of a pain
set up menu item for (1)
(8) 
(9) nuked the class, rebuilt and tested - 
	it fusses over method GeneticModelFactory.setupModelAndStateFromBase64Zip(String input)
	probably not needed - nuke the method.
		seems OK

for (12) & (1) look here https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gwt/gwt_fileupload_widget.htm
   got the file chooser dialog going.

this site https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9279216/reading-a-file-on-client-side-in-gwt/38321335
	has info on reading in a file.
	also try stealing code from FileUtils.js
	FileReader doesn't work so use the native method thingy described under "HTML5"
	
6/16/20
rats - can't use the file menus built into jsVGL
	won't be compatible with edX (they show all the time but save etc aren't appropriate for edX)
	they don't appear to work with file loading
- so build them into the javascript enclosing page (only present for non-edX uses)

new plan:
1) take out all the menus
2) rebuild it and be sure that save and load work as they used to
3) build the file menu (open, save, export) into the javascript enclosing page

used TimeMachine to recover jsVGL folder from 6/1/20 and copy in text of altered files (to avoid git-astrophe)

started by restoring original state
pasted in full content of
	JsVGL.java
	jsVGL.html
	JsVGL.css
- tested OK - thereby doing (1) and (2).

set up new version of jsVGLA.html for testing these - jsVGL_test.html
put in stuff for a dropdown menu from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp

6/17/20
need to build in a way to let the GWT project tell the javascript to enable/disable file menu items.
add methods like this https://shdhumale.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/gwt-application-calling-js-function-written-in-external-js-file/
and http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/pdf/ajax/GWT-JSNI.pdf

works but will need to add function to all jsVGL.html pages
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
	    function updateMenuStatus(state) {
			alert(state);
		}
	</script>
make an optional menuEnabler.js file - need to include in all pages that can save work (not edX)
	(edX pages will need an empty stub method)
	actually, it'd be nice if there was a way to test if the method is defined and not call it if it isn't
	did that in JsVGL.java

here's a way to enable/disable menu items
document.getElementById("saveWorkButton").disabled = true

it's all working EXCEPT:
- loading a saved work file
- exporting as html

6/18/20
got file save and load working AOK.
working on exporting as html
	just steal "GetWorkAsHTML.java" from VGLII - make new file in jsVGL and paste in code.
need to steal getWorkAsHTML() methods from
	ModelBuilderUI
	ModelPane
	LinkagPanel
	all the individual model details panels
a bunch of patching needed
	take out internationalization
looks like I need to replace things like sexLinkageChoices.getSelectedItem()
	with String.valueOf(sexLinkageChoices.getSelectedIndex()))
	since .getSelectedItem() doesn't exist in GWT
oops; that's wrong, you need 
	interactionTypeChoices.getItemText(interactionTypeChoices.getSelectedIndex())
also, no need to tell if we're getting html for grading or not - remove boolean argument
	(it looks like that was just for i18n)

got it working - need to test with a few different models

need to find a way to have 'boilerplate' html for header and footer in standard files so you don't have to edit them all
	and it's easier to make new ones.
	- it turns out that you can't.

probably best to save jsVGL_test.html under new names and then paste in the problem spec
	BE CAREFUL NOT TO MESS UP THE ONES FOR edX!!!

6/19/20
Next to-do list:
1) set it up with a page to load "canned" problems
	- save a bunch of .jsvgl files for lab with known models
	- make a page with a bunch of buttons "load Red and green wings" etc.
2) fix the .jsvgl pages for the website to use new version
	BE CAREFUL about edX versions - make separate folder.
3) build java application: jsvglFileReader
	- password to run
	- opens .jsvgl and shows real model and their model

First, fix the instructions to match the new UI.

need to do (2) first.
be careful of edX stuff
Each is run by a file JsVGL_V3.html uploaded to Studio.
These talk, in turn to jsVGL.js that uploaded to Studio along with xml2json.js
They use the javascript in /opt/bitnami/apps/edx/edx-platform/lms/static/SPOC/jsVGL/
(page 39)

Where is it used?
•	Lec 11 (basic genetics); core question 3: jsVGL1.html
•	Lec 11; extra practice problems; JsVGL_V3.html
•	Lec 13 (sex-linkage); core question 4: jsVGL2.html
•	Lec 13; extra practice problems; JsVGL_SexLink.html
None of those files are in war/ so they're safe

Which ones are linked by index.html? A thru F and "load".
	copy them all to folder on desktop
	in eclipse, delete all file text
		paste in the jsVGL_test.html code
		fix title
		paste in the params from the files in desktop folder (from bbedit)

will need to send clear out server directory and replace with these files
- stuff in jsvgl/
- FileSaver.js
- FileUtils.js
- index.html
- JsVGL.css
- jsVGL.js
- jsVGLA.html
- jsVGLB.html
- jsVGLC.html
- jsVGLD.html
- jsVGLE.html
- jsVGLF.html
- menuEnabler.js
- xml2json.js

1) made files
- simple dominance (jsVGLA.html)
	"Blue & Yellow Wings" Blue is dominant
	"Five & Six Legs" Five is dominant
- incomplete dominance (jsVGLB.html)
	"652 Antennae.jsvgl" Six is the heterozygote
	"BPY Eyes.jsvgl" Yellow is heterozygote
- sex-linkage (jsVGLC.html)
	"One & Six Antennae.jsvgl" XX/XY sex-linked; One is dominant
	"Yellow & Purple Eyes.jsvgl" XX/XY sex-linked; Purple is dominant

For these, since the text isn't huge - just put the json strings in-line
add a function to take the json string and make it xml and set the state with it loadInLine() to FileUtils.java
save modified version of jsVGL_test.html jsVGL_forLab.html
Works! Need to put the json in single quotes because it contains internal double-quotes.

6/22/20

posted all new stuff on web.

NEED TO put all the canned problems in a menu so it's not so cluttered (jsVGL_forLab.html)

for the jsvglReader
	- set it up to look in a directory of .jsvgl files
	- show real and student model also graded or not
	- steal a lot of code from VGLII.Grader.Grader - maybe just start by copying all that out
		will need to tune up WorkFileLoader
		no need for matching code or CageScorer (since already in the jsVGL).
		try to reduce the amount of VGL Genetic Model code
