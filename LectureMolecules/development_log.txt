tried putting it in google code
1) went to google code and made lecture-molecules site
2) on google code site set the repository to revision 0
3) svnsync init --username brian.white@umb.edu https://lecture-molecules.googlecode.com/svn 
		svn+ssh://brianmac2.bio.umb.edu/usr/local/SVN/trunk/LectureMolecules
		
	- seemed to work although exited with warning - killed by signal 15

4) svnsync sync --username brian.white@umb.edu https://lecture-molecules.googlecode.com/svn
