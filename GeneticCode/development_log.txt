loaded code from Freeland's thesis appendix I.doc
try to get it into svn

some changes from his thesis

1) in thesis, the file is set_up.c; in main.c, it is setup.c
	edited main.c to read "set_up.c"
2) in thesis, the file is codon.h; in main.c it is codons.c
	edited main.c to read "codon.c"
3) in thesis, there is no optimize.c
	but the file on pages xlvi and xlvii labeled with duplicate "n_samples.c"
	has the functions listed on page xvii as being in optimize.c
	so made optimize.c = the contents of pages xlvi & xlvii

more fixes
mut_calc.c line 110 is missing the function name and first few chars
using info on page xvi, add "void Build_Mutant_Array(SETTINGS_TYPE*"

try building by going into directory and
gcc main.c -o gen_code

some warnings, but no errors

tried to run it
need auxiliary files
made:
	a_acid_f.txt (based on fig 1i)
	PAM74100.txt (used OCR www.free-ocr.com on fig 1i)
	matrix_f.cod (using p xxvii and xxvii, it looks like UUU PHE)
		try this anyway..

seems to work aok!

added to 1_sample.c to print code specification and MS(0) to stdout
works
need to rearrange order to match the excel layout

3/1/11
1_sample.c now saves codes to codes.csv
	this can be read by r

add variance calc to 1_sample.c

now prints both

discrepancy between MS0 values calculated by excel and by this
(see Square Evolution Log 03.docx pages 28-33)
fixed by initializing num_stored_ptr to = 0 (not -1) in mut_calc.c's Build_Mutant_Array
line 113

now seems to log all mutations properly and give correct values

1/18/12
fixed code in mut_calc.c so that it is unambiguous (see Square Evolution Log 03 page 33)
tested AOK

3/4/15
imported into eclipse as a C++ project
