started more formal development
need to see if it can tell if it's in a zip file
try pwd - works on mac
but not on pc
need to use "echo %cd%" if windows
fails
use system.getProperty("user.dir")

zip file things
- on win xp, can't open if in zip
- on win 7, can, but the user.dir is C:\windows\system32
	so can search for that, after .toLowerCase()
	warning text should tell them that it is likely that it's zipped
	  see instructions for unzipping file that this came in on web
